<p>Just a quick one here while I think about it. I&#x2019;ve recently noticed there&#x2019;s a new kid on the corporate Twitter block, and they&#x2019;re not learning from the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8116869.stm">mistakes Habitat made earlier this year</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lloydspharmacy.com">Lloyds Pharmacy</a> (who have two locations on my High Street alone) have recently set up on Twitter and, <a href="http://www.lloydspharmacy.com/wps/portal/aboutus/aboutlloydspharmacy">judging by the spiel on their website</a>, they&#x2019;re keen on primary care and offering health services (sometimes for free) to local communities. They&#x2019;ve been using Twitter, therefore, to spread health messages as well as plug their own brand.</p>

<p>However, they&#x2019;re doing this wrong. Instead of promoting their presence on Twitter, following a few people here and there and building up a natural following, they&#x2019;re going with the scattergun approach, automatically sending out a tweet like this every time someone, whether they&#x2019;re following or not, mentions the word &#x2018;holiday&#x2019;:</p>

<p> Obviously a lot of users are annoyed by this, it&#x2019;s intrusive and spammy and certainly goes against the whole community-based, fluffy image that Lloyds tries to portray - I <a href="http://twitter.com/pezholio/statuses/3445389928">sent them a tweet</a> to this effect, but obviously they&#x2019;re not listening (again, a major no no in the world of corporate twittering). This just shows a major lack of research, making it seem like someone&#x2019;s heard about Twitter and gone out on their own, without doing any research into what&#x2019;s acceptable and what&#x2019;s not acceptable - very much like what happened with Habitat&#x2019;s &#x2018;intern&#x2019;, who used trending topics to try and get Habitat&#x2019;s tweets visible in Twitter&#x2019;s search.</p>

<p>I&#x2019;m all for learning, and I&#x2019;d like to think Lloyds will realise what they&#x2019;re doing is wrong, and go back to the drawing board, trying to understand more about what is and what isn&#x2019;t acceptable on Twitter, but I&#x2019;m not holding out any hope.</p>
