<p>For those of you who don&#x2019;t know, Twitter have recently announced <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2009/09/twitters-new-terms-of-service.html">new terms of service</a>, mainly in an attempt to clear up stuff about who owns your tweets, but also to try and stop the flood of spam.</p>

<p>Now, as someone who hates spam on Twitter with a passion bordering on the psychotic, this is a welcome thing, spam is the scourge of Twitter and really needs a serious effort on the part of Twitter to stamp it out. However, there was on term that piqued my interest:</p>

<blockquote><p>Some of the factors that we take into account when determining what conduct is considered to be spamming are&#x2026; If your updates consist mainly of links, and not personal updates</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, as someone who offers two bot-based services, <a href="http://twitter.com/localgovweb">Localgovweb</a> (which retweets any tweet with the #localgovweb hashtag and has 430 followers) and <a href="http://www.twitterplan.co.uk">Twitterplan</a> (which sends direct messages to users about planning applications in their area), this made me think - are my accounts going to be suspended because they don&#x2019;t offer personal updates?</p>

<p>It also calls into question many council Twitter accounts, which use the &#x2018;fire and forget&#x2019; method of setting up <a href="http://twitterfeed.com/">Twitterfeed</a> to tweet RSS news stories automatically - could they too be in breach of the TOS?</p>

<p>After thinking for a bit, I&#x2019;d probably say no, automated accounts are only likely to be suspended if you indulge in other types of spammy behaviour (such as mass following, spam complaints, a large number of blocks etc), so as long as you aren&#x2019;t doing this, you <em>should</em> be OK.</p>

<p>However, if you do run a bot, it might be worth reconsidering how you use Twitter - yes, automatic updates can be useful, but consider breaking up the automatic feeds with more personal updates - is there an event happening in your area that you might not have done a press release about? Or has someone tweeted something about the council that you&#x2019;d like to respond to?</p>

<p>Peppering your updates with personal stuff of this nature makes the council seem more open and more approachable (if you need some inpiration, check out <a href="http://twitter.com/walsallcouncil">Walsall Council&#x2019;s tweets</a>). Behaving like a robot is just going to make your organisation seem like just that, a robot.</p>
