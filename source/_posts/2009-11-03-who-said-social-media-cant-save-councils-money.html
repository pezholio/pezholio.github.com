<p>Certainly not me! We as councils are constantly being asked to save money, and one big element of this is front facing customer services. It&#x2019;s estimated that it costs councils &#xA3;6.56 to deal with enquiries face to face, &#xA3;3.22 by telephone contact, and 27p for online *.</p>

<p>So, imagine my joy when I get this tweet sent to <a href="http://twitter.com/lichfield_dc">@lichfield_dc</a>:</p>

<p>Now, we don&#x2019;t do roads, this is the responsibility of the county council, so I came back with this response:</p>

<p>This is the exact kind of response they&#x2019;d get by calling us up, so the council&#x2019;s Twitter account has made a cashable saving of &#xA3;3.22 today! It&#x2019;s baby steps, but it just goes to show that actively monitoring your Twitter presence can reap some real benefits.</p>

<li>Thanks to numerous people on Twitter for getting these stats for me!</li>
