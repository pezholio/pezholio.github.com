<p>I&#x2019;ve been thinking recently about trending topics on Twitter and how it would be brilliant if there could be some kind of local trending system that picked up trends in a local area. Twitter already has location based searching, so it should be pretty trivial for a developer (albeit one with more skill than me)</p>

<p>Step forward <a href="http://www.happn.in">happn.in</a>, which allows you to see trending topics based on a pre-defined list of cities. Birmingham (the UK one) <a href="http://happn.in/birm">has an entry</a>, so, after finding out the system had an <a href="http://api.happn.in">api</a>. I got cracking on playing with it.</p>

<p>The result is <a href="http://www.pezholio.co.uk/brumtrends.php">Brumtrends</a> (updated broken link, thanks to @prettysimple for pointing this out!) and it displays trending topics as a tag cloud with a lovely photo of Brum&#x2019;s skyline. I knocked it up in about half an hour, so be kind!</p>

<p>I would like to expand on this, with maybe a widget for blogs, but, for now I&#x2019;m taking a &#x2018;wait and see&#x2019; approach. At the moment it seems to only take a few tweets for something to trend, and trends don&#x2019;t seem to change too often. Hopefully this will get better though, and this will grow into a really interesting insight into what&#x2019;s going on in the Birmingham digital community.</p>
