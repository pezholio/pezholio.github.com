<p>During the <a href="http://lichhack.eventbrite.com/">Lichfield Hacks and Hackers day</a> yesterday (bigger blog post to come on that later) - I was gifted a list of <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0As1cSxPJOFWldEpxNDZady1aUmhIVTFXUjdjZHJ1M1E&amp;hl=en">grit bins in Lichfield District</a>, I got very excited about this, but my excitement was quickly dampened when I realised that there was no geographical data in the list, just road names and a vague location.</p>

<p>However, I then thought &#x2018;not to worry, I can just ask people who live nearby to geolocate them on their phones and add them to a Google Doc&#x2019;, I asked a <a href="http://twitter.com/robthedog">@robthedog</a> (who lives in a village north of the district) if he could do a few when he got home, his reply was &#x2018;I can do one now&#x2019;:</p>

<p>Of course! Google Street view! This is where you lot come in. I&#x2019;m going to crowdsource the location of these grit bins (I&#x2019;ve <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0As1cSxPJOFWldEpxNDZady1aUmhIVTFXUjdjZHJ1M1E&amp;hl=en#gid=0">already done a few myself</a>) - to help, all you need to do is follow a few simple steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Open up <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0As1cSxPJOFWldEpxNDZady1aUmhIVTFXUjdjZHJ1M1E&amp;hl=en#gid=0">this Google document</a></p></li>
<li><p>Drag <a href="javascript:void(prompt('',gApplication.getMap(">this bookmarklet to your browser&#x2019;s toolbar</a>.getCenter()));)</p></li>
<li><p>Open up <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk">Google Maps</a> and search for a road name and town / village which doesn&#x2019;t have a lat/lng yet</p></li>
<li><p>Drag the little yellow street view man (<a href="http://www.pezholio.co.uk/?attachment_id=405">this guy</a>) to the map and have a look round Street View for the grit bin</p></li>
<li><p>Once you&#x2019;re right by it - zoom out of Street View and click the bookmarklet - a window will pop up with the lat/lng - you can then copy and paste it and enter it into the Google doc!</p></li>
</ol>


<p>It&#x2019;s that simple! If you could do just a couple, I&#x2019;ll be forever in your debt (I might buy you a pint if I see you in the flesh too!)</p>

<p>Once it&#x2019;s done, I&#x2019;ll be able to build a handy map of grit bins in the area and hopefully save a few slips and falls (as well as a few costly calls to our contact centre!). There&#x2019;s 87of them, and, as I&#x2019;ve already done 10, it should be long before I&#x2019;ve got them all.</p>

<p>Thanks again, you lovely people you!</p>
