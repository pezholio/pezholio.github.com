<p>It&#x2019;s been a while since I first published my <a href="http://www.pezholio.co.uk/2009/03/a-beginners-guide-to-twitter-in-local-government/">Beginners&#x2019; Guide to Twitter in Local Government</a>, and since then (although, obviously not as a direct result of my blog post!) there&#x2019;s been a plethora of local authorities using Twitter.</p>

<p>However, with a few notable exceptions, most councils seem to prefer the &#x2018;fire and forget&#x2019; method of sticking an RSS feed into <a href="http://twitterfeed.com/">Twitterfeed</a> and leaving it to run. Hell, even I was guilty of it up until recently - even though I was making an effort to monitor and engage, I was still letting the news articles automatically publish via Twitterfeed.</p>

<p>There&#x2019;s been a bit of a discussion recently via Twitter as to the rights and wrongs of this, and I&#x2019;m definitely in the &#x2018;wrong&#x2019; camp now - A few months ago I turned off the RSS feed for <a href="http://www.twitter.com/lichfield_dc">@lichfield_dc</a> press releases and now do them manually. Why? Well, I shall tell you&#x2026;</p>

<h3>You don&#x2019;t talk to a robot</h3>

<p>Twitter is, by and large, a social medium - if all you&#x2019;re doing is chucking out press releases, people will assume you&#x2019;re not interested in engaging or are just going to generate boring content. This means you aren&#x2019;t going to get followed by as many people who might otherwise be interested in you.</p>

<h3>Auto tweets look ugly</h3>

<p>Take <a href="http://www.lichfielddc.gov.uk/site/custom_scripts/newsblog.php?id=204">this press release for example</a>. If I were to use an auto tweeter, here&#x2019;s what it would look like:</p>

<blockquote><p>News: Everyone is invited to get into the festive spirit at this year&#x2019;s Christmas Fayre taking place in the city&#x2026; <a href="http://is.gd/5eZUT">http://is.gd/5eZUT</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Pretty boring huh? Plus the content gets cut short and can often not make sense. However, if I conjour up a manual tweet, I can tailor it much more to the Twitter medium and come up with something a lot more friendly:</p>

<p>[tweet url=&#x201D;http://twitter.com/lichfield_dc/statuses/6432523654&#x201D;]</p>

<p>This means you can get your message across much more easily and in a style that fits in with Twitter&#x2019;s informal approach.</p>

<h3>Stopping information overload</h3>

<p>Sometimes you&#x2019;ll have a press release which, while it might be relevant for the website, might not be suitbale for Twitter. If you&#x2019;re blindly tweeting everything you put out, then people might be much more likely to be turned off by your content and reach for that big button marked &#x2018;unfollow&#x2019;.</p>

<h3>This is all well and good, but&#x2026;</h3>

<p>&#x2026;I can hear the objections already - &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t have time to write manual tweets&#x2019; - but how difficult it it to write a 140 character tweet? If you&#x2019;re going to take online engagement seriously, it&#x2019;s definitely worth just taking 2 minutes to show your followers you care.</p>

<p>If you really must use automated tweets, then make sure you mark your account up as such - call it something like &#x2018;councilx_news&#x2019; and state very clearly that all you&#x2019;re doing is publishing the latest news - then if further down the line you decide to engage a bit more, you can start another account for more human interaction.</p>

<h3>I&#x2019;m a massive hypocrite</h3>

<p>However, after saying all this, I do agree that sometimes, automated tweets have their place. We do still tweet food safety inspections, and <a href="http://twitter.com/ldcplanning">@ldcplanning</a> has been happily tweeting planning applications for a while now. However, it&#x2019;s not really practical to tweet large volume, samey tweets manually, and you don&#x2019;t get the same advantages with tweeting press releases.</p>

<p>In fact, I recently did a straw poll amongst our followers about whether to get rid of the food safety tweets, especially as much of the content is replicated by <a href="http://twitter.com/ratemyplace">@ratemyplace</a>, but the majority seemed to like them. So maybe automated tweets isn&#x2019;t as open and shut a case as I&#x2019;d like it to be?</p>
