<p><img src="http://www.pezholio.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Untitled.jpg" alt="Underground bunker">I&#x2019;m a big fan of 1950&#x2019;s artwork, so imagine my joy when I come across <a href="http://www.pezholio.co.uk/nuclear.pdf">this little beauty</a> in a long forgotten box at work.</p>

<p>It&#x2019;s called &#x2018;The Hydrogen Bomb&#x2019; and (I assume) is from the early 50&#x2019;s - some of the artwork is fantastic (especially the oh-so-helpful diagram telling you to sit under the stairs) and it&#x2019;s a prime example of the &#x2018;keep calm and carry on&#x2019; ethos of the post war era.</p>

<p>&#x2018;Cos I&#x2019;m nice, I&#x2019;ve scanned it and uploaded it for yis - and you can <a href="http://www.pezholio.co.uk/nuclear.pdf">download it here</a>.</p>

<p>We also came across a few tourism brochures from about the same period, which we&#x2019;re hoping to get uploaded and scanned to the council site - my favourite bit is <a href="http://www.twitpic.com/h6n22">this advert, advertising the local area&#x2019;s cheap and abundant supply of electricity</a>. Ah, the good old days!</p>
