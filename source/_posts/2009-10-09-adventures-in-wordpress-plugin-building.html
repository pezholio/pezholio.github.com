<div class='post'>
<p>I love Wordpress (hell, I use it for my blog don&#x2019;t I?) and for a while I&#x2019;ve been looking for an excuse to add to the community and build a plugin.</p>

<p>Whilst working on a <a href="http://www2.lichfielddc.gov.uk/northlichfield">new community blog for the North Lichfield Initiative</a> I found that excuse.</p>

<p>The guy I was training to update the blog wanted an easy way to show Flickr slideshows on posts and pages and didn&#x2019;t want to mess around with code. I first tried using <a href="http://www.flickrslideshow.com/">Flickr Slideshow</a>, which generates code to embed Flickr slideshows into websites, but found that the visual editor strips away the iframe code when you publish the post.</p>

<p>I searched and searched through the Wordpress plugins, but couldn&#x2019;t find anything that did what I wanted to do quickly and easily - so I rolled up my sleeves and got my hands dirty!</p>

<p>The result is <a href="http://www.pezholio.co.uk/my-work/flickr-slideshow/">Flickr Flash Slideshow</a> - all you need to do is put the link the to user, set or group you want a slideshow of between [ flickr][ /flickr] tags (without the spaces) like so:</p>

<p>[ flickr]url[ /flickr]</p>

<p>You can also add the width or height of the slideshow like so:</p>

<p>[ flickr]url,width,height[ /flickr]</p>

<p>If the width and height is left out, then the plugin defaults to 300px x 300px</p>

<p>Check out an example here:</p>

<p>[flickr]http://www.flickr.com/groups/894733@N22/[/flickr]</p>

<p>I was amazed by how quickly I could put it together and it&#x2019;s further cemented my belief that Wordpress is one of the best, if not best open source projects ever -  a lot of projects could learn from its ease and extensibility.</p>

<p>Anyways, if you want the plugin, please <a href="/flickr-flash-slideshow.zip">Download it here</a> and let me know if you have any problems! I&#x2019;m sure it&#x2019;ll come in handy for a lot of community based sites who&#x2019;s users may not have enough technical knowledge to edit raw HTML.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I&#x2019;ve finally got access to the Wordpress SVN repository, so you should be able to install it directly from your admin section - just search for &#x2018;Flickr Flash Slideshow&#x2019;</p>
