<p><img src="http://www.pezholio.co.uk/images/api.gif" alt="A nice little api icon on a wet floor. As you do.">Well, it&#x2019;s was a busy old day for me yesterday, sitting in the warm at home and establishing myself in the blogosphere, and I&#x2019;ve been blown away by how much traffic my last post attracted. It was one of the commenters on my last post (<a href="http://martinrstone.wordpress.com/">Martin Stone</a>) who inspired me to post today. He said:</p>

<blockquote><p>Great stuff&#x2026; do you know of any other government apis available as feeds like the planning alert? Perhaps we (you) could start a list.</p></blockquote>

<p>And, as requested, I have! I&#x2019;ve quickly <a href="http://www.pezholio.co.uk/localgovapi/">hacked up a list</a> that feeds all the links to APIs that have been tagged &#x2018;localgovapi&#x2019; from social bookmarking site <a href="http://www.delicious.com">delicious</a> (Using a similar method that the DIUS uses for its <a href="http://sandbox.dius.gov.uk/digitalgovuk/">digitalgovuk</a> list). There&#x2019;s a fair few links there already, but I&#x2019;m sure there&#x2019;s plenty of stuff I&#x2019;ve missed.</p>

<p><strong>This is where you, dear reader, come in</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.pezholio.co.uk/localgovapi/">Take a look at the list</a>, and if there&#x2019;s anything I&#x2019;ve missed, <a href="http://www.delicious.com">jump on delicious</a> (<a href="https://secure.delicious.com/register">start an account</a> if you haven&#x2019;t already) and tag any links with the tag &#x2018;localgovapi&#x2019;. Through the magic of PHP and the <a href="http://simplepie.org/">Simple Pie library</a>, my page will pick it up! It&#x2019;s quite hacky at the moment, and, depending on the success of the feature, I might make some amendments.</p>

<p>APIs are a great and very powerful way for councils and government departments to share information, be it with other government organisations, or just your <a href="http://rewiredstate.org/">average Joe Blogs web developer</a>.</p>

<p>I&#x2019;m so convinced of their power, <a href="http://www.ratemyplace.org.uk/newsite/api.php">I&#x2019;ve built one myself</a>. I&#x2019;m also dead excited about the work that DirectGov are planning with <a href="http://innovate.direct.gov.uk/">innovate.direct.gov.uk</a>, so it&#x2019;d be great to see more examples &#x2018;in the wild&#x2019; as it were.</p>

<p>As always, any comments, questions etc, let me know!</p>
