<p><img src="http://www.pezholio.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Untitled-11.jpg" alt="Royal Fail">Well, it happened. today, the Royal Mail have <a href="http://ernestmarples.com/blog/">issued ernestmarples.com with a takedown notice</a>, demanding that the service be taken down immediately under pain of legal action.</p>

<p>For those of you who don&#x2019;t know, <a href="http://www.ernestmarples.com">Ernest Marples</a> was / is a system that provided not-for-profit sites (such as <a href="http://www.mappage.org/hw/">HealthWhere</a>, <a href="http://jobcentreproplus.com/">JobcentreProPlus.com</a>, <a href="http://www.planningalerts.com">Planning Alerts</a> and, by extension <a href="http://www.twitterplan.co.uk/">Twitterplan</a>) with latitude and longitude data from postcodes, which means that people can get information about their areas with only their postcode.</p>

<p>Because Ernest Marples has been served with this notice, none of these sites can function, meaning the Royal Mail (who are <em>supposed</em> to be a public service)  are directly responsible for taking away a wealth of useful tools from the public it&#x2019;s <em>supposed</em> to serve.</p>

<p>Judging by the <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=royal+mail">flurry of outcry on Twitter</a>, the Royal Mail are not a popular bunch because of this decision, and have really shot themselves in the foot PR wise.</p>

<p>Instead of getting heavy-handed with the lawyers, why didn&#x2019;t they enter with a dialogue with Harry and Richard (the people behind the site) and try and come up with an alternative license for volunteer-built, community focused sites of this nature?</p>

<p>I can sort of understand them wanting to protect their revenue stream (although it&#x2019;s arguable that this data should be in the public domain anyway), but because these sites are built by volunteers and make no money, they aren&#x2019;t going to have the funding to fork out the &#xA3;4k per year to have access to the official postcode database - so the Royal Mail aren&#x2019;t losing out on any extra cash anyway. All they&#x2019;ve done is picked up their ball and gone off in a strop, meaning no one can play anymore.</p>

<p>I&#x2019;m hoping that something can be worked out, because it&#x2019;d be a crying shame if this service (or something similar) didn&#x2019;t get going again.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I&#x2019;ve submitted a <a href="http://petitions.number10.gov.uk/nfppostcodes/">petition to Number 10 about this</a>, not sure how much good it&#x2019;ll do, but it&#x2019;s worth a try! Please sign, retweet, pass around by any means you can!</p>
