In case you&#x2019;ve had your head buried in a good few feet of sand, then you&#x2019;ll know all about the <a href="http://www.pezholio.co.uk/2009/09/a-few-thoughts-on-birmingham-city-councils-website/">issues surrounding the new Birmingham City Council website</a>. I won&#x2019;t get into it too much here, but, suffice to say, the project was over budget, late and didn&#x2019;t deliver half of what is expected from a modern .gov.uk website.</p>

<p>We&#x2019;re all aware of over budget government schemes that deliver less than the sum of their parts, but the interesting stuff didn&#x2019;t stop there, in fact, it&#x2019;s only just started - a group of passionate web type people (developers, designers, proofreaders and the like) have got together to build <a href="http://bccdiy.com/">BCC DIY</a>, a site that tries to give the people of Birmingham a better web experience.</p>

<p>As well as scraping the existing content of the original Birmingham City Council site (and publishing it in a wiki format - so people can edit and change at will), it also brings in external tools, such as <a href="http://www.fixmystreet.com/">FixMyStreet</a> and <a href="http://planningalerts.com/">Planning Alerts</a>, so people can see, at a glance, what&#x2019;s going on in their area.</p>

<p>The work really got going last Friday with a <a href="http://bccdiy.eventbrite.com/">hack day up at Moseley Exchange</a> (which I wanted to get to, but sadly car trouble prevented me) where people from across Birmingham (and beyond - <a href="http://al-smith.co.uk/">Al Smith</a> - Newcastle City Council&#x2019;s Web 2.0 guy, made a special trip down for the occasion) got together for a big heave ho to get the project up and running.</p>

<p>The results, while not reflective of a fully formed project (yet), are impressive, and for me, as a local government webbie, really interesting.</p>

<p>While usability studies can tell us a lot, they are often informed by our own ideas and prejudices. BCC DIY shows us the kind of website that people who spend a lot of time on the web (and often work in the sector too) want from a website and gives us a fresh view of local government online.</p>

<p>Obviously, what &#x2018;web people&#x2019; want from a website may well be different from what less web savvy people want, but it&#x2019;s a viewpoint, and one that reflects the views of a lot of our users. I&#x2019;m continuing to watch with interest.</p>
