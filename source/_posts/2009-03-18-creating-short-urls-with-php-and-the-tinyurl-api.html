<p>With the increasing popularity of Twitter and the like, it&#x2019;s becoming more and more important to keep those characters down with URL shortening services such as <a href="http://is.gd">is.gd</a>, <a href="http://cli.gs">cli.gs</a> and of course, the ubiquitous <a href="http://tinyurl.com">TinyURL</a></p>

<p>A lot of these services offer <a href="http://www.pezholio.co.uk/tag/api/">APIs</a>, taking a long url and returning the short url. But a lot of these are returned in JSON or XML format, meaning that you have to use a lot of extra time and processing power parsing the output to get the URL, and if you want to do that a lot of times, that&#x2019;s a whole lot of extra strain on your server.</p>

<p>However, TinyURL has an ace up it&#x2019;s sleeve, a (as far as I can see) undocumented API, which adheres the the principle of KISS design. It just returns your shortened URL in plain text. The format is as follows:</p>

<p><code>http://tinyurl.com/api-create.php?url=**[URL here]**</code></p>

<p>We can then have a nice simple PHP function that takes our URL as the input and returns the TinyURL like so:</p>

<p><code>
function tinyurl($url) {
$url = "http://tinyurl.com/api-create.php?url=" . $url;
$tinyurl = file_get_contents($url);
return $tinyurl;
}
</code></p>

<p>Simple, n&#x2019;est ce pas?</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>I&#x2019;ve just noticed that is.gd offer a <a href="http://is.gd/api_info.php">similarly simple API</a>, so to get an even shorter URL, simply replace the tinyurl element with:</p>

<p><code>http://is.gd/api.php?longurl=</code></p>

<p>Da da! Your very own is.gd link!</p>
