<p><img src="http://ernestmarples.com/images/go.jpg" alt="">Pity the poor postcode, for years, he&#x2019;s been locked up in a basement at the Royal Mail offices, and only let out if someone pays a humungous fee to let him out.</p>

<p>Well, thanks to the mysterious <a href="http://ernestmarples.com">Ernest Marples</a>, the postcode has been let out of his cell and is free to run about, jump and play and be used in all sorts of useful applications.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://ernestmarples.com">Ernest Marples API</a> allows you to enter a postcode and get a latitude and longitude, allowing web-based applications to get a user&#x2019;s location from their postcode.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://jobcentreproplus.com/">few</a> <a href="http://www.planningalerts.com/">apps</a> <a href="http://thestraightchoice.com/">are</a> <a href="http://voteuk.shkspr.mobi/">already</a> <a href="http://livebus.org/">using</a> this, and with the API finally out in the open, hopefully more apps will join the club!</p>

<p>But how are they going to get away with this? Well, my theory is (and I&#x2019;ve not spoken to anyone involved in the project to confirm this) that as long as it&#x2019;s only used by volunteer / non-profit projects, then the Royal Mail ain&#x2019;t gonna do diddly squat. They&#x2019;re not losing any revenue by sites of this nature doing this because the sites couldn&#x2019;t afford to pay for the postcode database anyway. Besides, although the Royal Mail is effectively a private enterprise, the major shareholder is still the government, and I can&#x2019;t see them risking the bad publicity that would be caused by being heavy-handed and taking the site down.</p>

<p>However, I do think there are risks in putting this data out there, although the Royal Mail might not be bothered by non-profit sites using this data, they might be bothered by corporates (who would otherwise be paying) using it. Therefore I think the best way forward would be to make the API private - get developers to sign up for an API key and let &#x2018;Ernest&#x2019; know how they&#x2019;re planning to use it. That way, for profit sites don&#x2019;t get a look in.</p>

<p>It&#x2019;s certainly exciting though, and my best wishes go out to &#x2018;Ernest&#x2019;. I shall watch the future with interest!</p>
