<p><img src="http://www.pezholio.co.uk/images/bird.jpg" alt="">Today marks a coming together (if you&#x2019;re an idiot, you might call it a synergy), of all the obsessions I&#x2019;ve blogged about so far - Planning Applications, APIs and Twitter. It&#x2019;s called <a href="http://www.twitterplan.co.uk/">TwitterPlan</a>, and it allows you to receive alerts of planning applications in your area via Twitter.</p>

<p>It uses the <a href="http://www.planningalerts.com/apihowto.php">Planning Alerts API</a> and sends DMs (direct messages) every time a planning application is listed. Most UK local authorities are covered, but if your council isn&#x2019;t covered you&#x2019;ll start receiving alerts as soon as one of the Planning Alerts community build a screen scraper for your council.</p>

<p>It&#x2019;s still in Alpha stage at the moment (that is, it&#x2019;s still under development), but I&#x2019;d like as many people signed up as possible so I can test the functionality and get feedback on how you&#x2019;d like the project to move forward.</p>

<p>Many thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/abeeken">@abeeken</a> at City of Lincoln council and <a href="http://twitter.com/michaeldpollard">@MichaelDPollard</a> for helping me overcome my lack of confidence in the design side of things and beautifying the site with the design and birdy character. Thanks also to <a href="http://www.memespring.co.uk/">Richard Pope</a> from Planning Alerts for his advice and feedback. I couldn&#x2019;t have done it withoutcha guys!</p>

<p>So what are you waiting for? <a href="http://www.twitterplan.co.uk">Get signed up!</a></p>
