<p>Shamefully, it&#x2019;s been almost a year since my last blog post, but I&#x2019;ve finally decided to get my act together and get cracking with a brand new blog!</p>

<p>As much as I love Wordpress, I&#x2019;m starting to think it&#x2019;s becoming a bit too bloated to be a blogging platform, and, with this in mind (and just because I like fiddling), I&#x2019;ve switched to <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>.</p>

<p>Octopress is most definitely for hackers. It&#x2019;s built in Ruby, and, rather than relying on a database like Wordpress does, it generates pages on your local machine, which you then push to a remote repository.</p>

<p>The benefits of this is you can get free hosting (I use <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github pages</a>, but you can also use <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>), and, as the pages are static HTML, you&#x2019;ll always have a super fast blog (so no more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdot_effect">Slashdot effect</a> if you get a lot of traffic!).</p>

<p>Another benefit is that you can write your pages in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, which is a great way of writing text that converts to HTML with the minimum of fuss.</p>

<p>I&#x2019;ve used a (slightly customised) version of the <a href="https://github.com/bijumon/oct2">Oct2</a> theme, as although I like the default Octopress theme, as Octopress gets more prevelant, so does the default Octopress theme, and I like to stand out from the crowd. There&#x2019;s <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/List-Of-Octopress-Themes">not a lot of themes out there</a>, but I&#x2019;m told the next version of Ocotopress makes theming a lot easier, so expect to see more kicking around soon.</p>

<p>I&#x2019;ve also <a href="https://github.com/thomasf/exitwp">imported all my blog posts from Wordpress using Exitwp</a>, so my old brain dumps will always be available for all the world to see. Some of the Markdown is a bit funky (particularly on the code side of things), so that needs sorting. I&#x2019;m also working on importing my old comments too.</p>

<p>All in all, for me, Octopress is a more enjoyable way to blog, so hopefully you&#x2019;ll be seeing much more blogging from me. I&#x2019;m also interested to know any tips or gotchas on blogging from Octopress users (I&#x2019;m particularly keen to know about good Markdown editors for OSX), so let me know in the comments!</p>
