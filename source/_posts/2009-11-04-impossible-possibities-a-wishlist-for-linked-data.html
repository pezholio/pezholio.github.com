<p>I&#x2019;ve been playing around with the <a href="http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/">Ordnance Survey linked data</a> and, while it&#x2019;s not perfect, it&#x2019;s certainly a step in the right direction.</p>

<p>It&#x2019;s got me thinking though - in an ideal world, where an &#x2018;information-wants-to-be-free&#x2019;-esque hippy such as myself could get <strong>all</strong> the data I wanted, what cool stuff could be added on to this dataset to make it <em>really</em> useful?</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Shape files for all administrative regions</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>Yes, now this really is cloud cuckoo land, I know we can use the unit ID in combination with OpenSpace to display the layers, but, let&#x2019;s be honest, OpenSpace isn&#x2019;t great.</p>

<p>As with the linked data, it&#x2019;s a step in the right direction, but the mapping (until you get down to street view) is not designed for screen, and the API is still a bit too buggy. I know there&#x2019;s also a few licensing issues that a couple of people aren&#x2019;t too comfortable with.  Besides, shouldn&#x2019;t we be able to use the platform that we want to use?</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Postcodes in every administrative region</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>This is where things get <strong>really</strong> cool, imagine if in every resource, there was a list of every postcode contained in that area - for example, looking at the resource for the <a href="http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/doc/7000000000010183">resource for Coleshill</a>, we could have listed every single postcode in that parish.</p>

<p>This would mean that, once others started making datasets that used the OS linked data URIs as identifiers, a simple postcode search would reveal everything that was relevant to that area.</p>

<p>Even better, every postcode could have its own URI (for example <a href="http://data.royalmail.co.uk/postcode/WS13+6YY">http://data.royalmail.co.uk/postcode/WS13+6YY</a> (now you know I&#x2019;m dreaming!)) which gave information about where that postcode was (lat/long, parish, police authority, council etc etc).</p>

<p>This is just a taster to get some conversation going, but please feel free to add your own ideas in the comments. Forget about licensing, let&#x2019;s just imagine a brave new world of free data without limits and just go mad on this thing.</p>
