<p><img src="http://www.pezholio.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/foursquare.png" alt="">Foursquare. It&#x2019;s just a vanity publishing tool that takes over your Twitter stream and Facebook feed right? OK, I&#x2019;m as guilty as the next Foursquare user for checking in to the pub at lunchtime and telling all my Twitter followers, but Foursquare can actually be a pretty useful tool for giving visitors and residents useful information about their surroundings.</p>

<p>As well as being able to check into places and see where your friends are, Foursquare also allows you to leave &#x2018;tips&#x2019; about venues for your friends and followers, so when they check into that venue (or one nearby), they&#x2019;ll see this tip. I&#x2019;ve left a couple of tips on my personal Foursquare account (mainly plugging nights I play at, or calling out bad service at restaurants), but I&#x2019;ve always thought Foursquare tips could be really useful for our tourism team, highlighting special offers and also giving historical titbits of information about places in the district.</p>

<p>I never really knew how to get started with a Foursquare page until I read <a href="http://josephstashko.com/media/using-foursquare-with-hyperlocal/">Joseph Stashko&#x2019;s post</a> on how he added a <a href="http://foursquare.com/blogpreston">Foursquare page for Blog Preston</a>. I&#x2019;ll leave you to read Joseph&#x2019;s explanation on how he got set up, but needless to say, the sign up process is a little bit convoluted (To be fair, Foursquare say they will be changing this soon).</p>

<p>That said, once I&#x2019;d filled everything out, got our designer to design a header and sent it all off to Foursquare, I was up and running within a few hours (together with a nice personal response from a Foursquare staffer).</p>

<p>You can now see the results on the <a href="http://foursquare.com/visitlichfield">Visit Lichfield Foursquare page</a>. I&#x2019;ve added a few tips in and around Lichfield City with historical information that I know about personally, together with a few special offers, and I&#x2019;m looking at getting a few more tips added after talking to our Green Badge guides (who know much more about Lichfield&#x2019;s history than me) before launching the page officially (bizarrely, we already seem to have 600+ followers without doing any promotion, mainly people from Indonesia and New York).</p>

<p>However, it&#x2019;s not just tourism that Foursquare can help with, I&#x2019;d love to develop something like <a href="http://donteat.at/">donteat.at</a>, which uses public data on food safety inspections in New York to warn you if you&#x2019;re about to eat at a place with a poor hygiene report, and if you&#x2019;re a council with a lot of venues, you could leave tips about upcoming events or special offers. The only limit, as they say, is your imagination!</p>

<p>If anyone else has any useful tips on local gov using Foursquare, I&#x2019;d love to hear them - drop me a line in the comments.</p>
