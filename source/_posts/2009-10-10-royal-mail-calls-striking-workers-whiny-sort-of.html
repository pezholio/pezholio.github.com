<p>Now, I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;re fed up of me <a href="http://www.pezholio.co.uk/2009/10/one-step-forward-two-steps-back-ernest-marples-and-the-idiocy-of-the-royal-mail/">banging on</a> <a href="http://www.pezholio.co.uk/2009/10/royal-fail-part-2-lets-do-something/">about the Royal Mail</a>, but bare with me, this isn&#x2019;t about postcodes.</p>

<p>Whilst idily surfing around Twitter using <a href="http://www.atebits.com/tweetie-iphone/">Tweetie 2</a> (which is awesome by the way), I thought I&#x2019;d have a look at <a href="">Royal Mail&#x2019;s Twitter account</a> to see if they&#x2019;d had anything to say about the Ernest Marples postcode debacle.</p>

<p>Looking at their account, I noticed that they&#x2019;d favourited a tweet, on closer inspection it appeared to be this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pezholio.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/royalfail.png"><img src="http://www.pezholio.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/royalfail.png" alt="It is written into the CWU constitution that Royal Mail must go on strike once every 4 months. Whiny fucks."></a></p>

<p>Now, correct me if I&#x2019;m wrong, when you favourite a tweet, you&#x2019;re effectively validating the opinion of the tweeter and saying that you agree with it.</p>

<p>This is wholly unprofessional, and to write off the concerns of thousands of workers whose jobs are at risk by calling them &#x2018;whiny fucks&#x2019; is at best, clumsy, and at worst, insensitive - whatever you as an organisation think about the rights and wrongs of them striking.</p>

<p>I&#x2019;m sure this will be attributed to the actions of an <a href="http://www.brandrepublic.com/News/915903/Habitat-blames-Twitter-faux-pas-intern/">over zealous intern</a>, but it really does highlight how you should tread carefully when on Twitter, especially if you&#x2019;re a publicly owned organisation such as the Royal Mail.</p>
