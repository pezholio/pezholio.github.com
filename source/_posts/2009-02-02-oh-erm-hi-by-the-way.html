</ul>


<h3>Things I do</h3>

<ul>

</ul>


<p>I&#x2019;m hoping to mainly update this blog with tutorials, thoughts and ideas about web development and social media in the local authority / government area, but I&#x2019;ll also be sticking mixes up that I do occasionally and blogging about other general bits and bobs as I see fit.</p>

<p>If you think I sound like an interesting person, then please <a href="http://www.twitter.com/pezholio">follow me on Twitter</a>, and, if I like the look of you, I&#x2019;ll follow back! (Twitter policy coming soon folks!)</p>

<p>Anyways, hope you enjoy my corner of the ol&#x2019; world wide web, and I hope to be giving you lots on interesting content on a (semi) regular basis</p>
