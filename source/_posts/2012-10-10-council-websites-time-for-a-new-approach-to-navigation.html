<p>If you spend any amount of time on different council websites (like I do, sad as I am), you&#x2019;ll noticed that most of them will have a similar navigation structure, starting with categories like Advice and Benefits, Environment and Planning, Transport and Streets etc.</p>

<p>This is known as the Local Government Navigation List (or LGNL), and it&#x2019;s been going since the early days of eGovernment (remember that?), backed up by a steering group of people who shape and mould the list as time goes on.</p>

<p>I&#x2019;ve been of the opinion that it is in serious need of reexamining for some time now - I don&#x2019;t feel it&#x2019;s customer focussed, there are too many levels and it can, in some cases be far too detailed for a council website navigation.</p>

<p>That said, I&#x2019;ve shrugged my shoulders and put up with it, as for some time I&#x2019;ve believed that the future of website navigation is search. Why put up with clicking endless links when you can just type a few words in and (generally) get to what you&#x2019;re looking for. It&#x2019;s what I do and what (I assumed) most people would do too.</p>

<p>However, you know what they say about assumption, and I was surprised to see that, in their latest redesign, <a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2012/10/03/why-weve-changed-the-homepage/">the gov.uk team are dropping the idea of a big search bar on the homepage, and going back to good old fashioned navigation</a>.</p>

<p>You can see more about their rationale on the blog post, but, suffice to say, it&#x2019;s backed up by hours of testing with real users, the same sort of users that we have on our council&#x2019;s website, and it does makes sense.</p>

<p>This leaves us with a problem, if search isn&#x2019;t the way forward, where does that leave LGNL? If, as I think, LGNL is in serious need of looking at, then what can we do?</p>

<p>I put up a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0As1cSxPJOFWldHBYU0tDNlFldTNmM1ZNT1I5VDF6X0E">Google doc yesterday</a> to kick around a few ideas, and already, I could see it was becoming monolithic, exactly like the LGNL I would like to see killed off. So what is the future?</p>

<p>I believe we need a user tested, people focused navigation system, with no more than two levels, but one that isn&#x2019;t prescriptive, and can be moulded and shifted to meet the needs of a particular council. Maybe this is something that any potential <a href="http://blog.pezholio.co.uk/2012/09/local-gds-a-skunkworks-for-local-government/">local GDS can do</a>?</p>

<p>I don&#x2019;t have all the answers, but I think it&#x2019;s a discussion we need to have. As always, let&#x2019;s have those thoughts in the comments.</p>
