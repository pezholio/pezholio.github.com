<p>Certainly not me! We as councils are constantly being asked to save money, and one big element of this is front facing customer services. It&#x2019;s estimated that it costs councils &#xA3;6.56 to deal with enquiries face to face, &#xA3;3.22 by telephone contact, and 27p for online *.</p>

<p>So, imagine my joy when I get this tweet sent to <a href="http://twitter.com/lichfield_dc">@lichfield_dc</a>:</p>

<p>[tweet url=http://twitter.com/JoshandArchie/status/5390162309]</p>

<p>Now, we don&#x2019;t do roads, this is the responsibility of the county council, so I came back with this response:</p>

<p>[tweet url=http://twitter.com/Lichfield_DC/status/5390256583]</p>

<p>This is the exact kind of response they&#x2019;d get by calling us up, so the council&#x2019;s Twitter account has made a cashable saving of &#xA3;3.22 today! It&#x2019;s baby steps, but it just goes to show that actively monitoring your Twitter presence can reap some real benefits.</p>

<ul>
<li>Thanks to numerous people on Twitter for getting these stats for me!</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<p>In case you&#x2019;ve been living under a rock for the past month or so (or actually have a life), then you&#x2019;ll have noticed that the cabinet office have started to release a big load of open data to a select few developers to have a play.</p>

<p>Much of this data is still in very &#x2018;flat&#x2019; formats (such as Excel docs and the like), but some data is being released in RDFa format, the preferred format of the semantic web.</p>

<p>The most interesting of these datasets has been the education one, giving me (and other developers) the ability to get information about schools in an open format. I&#x2019;ve been playing with this data for a bit, and now (I think) I might have something useful.</p>

<p>The key way of interacting with it is using a language called SPARQL, which is very similar to SQL, but with the web of data in mind. An example query for the education dataset is as follows:</p>

<p><code>
prefix sch-ont: http://education.data.gov.uk/ontology/school#
SELECT ?name WHERE {
?school a sch-ont:School;
sch-ont:establishmentName ?name;
sch-ont:districtAdministrative
http://education.data.gov.uk/placeholder-id/administrativeDistrict/Lichfield ;
}
ORDER BY ?name
</code></p>

<p>This gets the names of all the educational establishments (schools, nurseries etc) in Lichfield District. You can <a href="http://services.data.gov.uk/education/sparql">give it a try yourself on the public facing SPARQL endpoint</a>.</p>

<p>What I wanted to do though, was to get all the primary or secondary schools within a 2 mile radius of a postcode. This was a little harder, but perfectly doable.</p>

<p>As well as general details (such as address, name of school etc) and more detailed information (such as capacity, inspection details etc), the dataset also has the easting and northing of the school. Therefore, to get all Primary Schools within a 2 mile radius of a point with an easting of 411021 and a northing of 307291, I needed to do the following query:</p>

<p><code>
prefix sch-ont: http://education.data.gov.uk/ontology/school#
SELECT ?name ?address1 ?address2 ?postcode ?town ?easting ?northing ?reference WHERE {
?school a sch-ont:School;
sch-ont:establishmentName ?name;
sch-ont:easting ?easting ;
sch-ont:northing ?northing ;
sch-ont:uniqueReferenceNumber ?reference ;
sch-ont:phaseOfEducation http://education.data.gov.uk/ontology/school#PhaseOfEducation_Primary .
FILTER (?easting  414239  ?easting  411021  ?northing  310509
 ?northing  307291)
}
</code></p>

<p>This gets the name, easting, northing and reference number of every school within a 2 mile (3201-ish metre) box, with the original easting and northing as the midpoint.</p>

<p>I&#x2019;ve given it a test here (a bit of naughtiness is required using the Google Maps API to get the latitude and longitude of the postcode, but it&#x2019;s the only way at the moment!), so please feel free to try it out.</p>

<p>Once you submit the form you&#x2019;ll get a list of all the primary and secondary schools in that area, as well as a link to more info on the Edubase site.</p>

<p>Postcode</p>

<p>School Type</p>

<p>Primary
Secondary</p>

<p>I&#x2019;d be interested to know your thoughts, so please feel free to comment! :)</p>

<p>There&#x2019;s also a few more example queries on the <a href="http://blogs.talis.com/n2/archives/818">Talis Blog</a>, so if you&#x2019;re that way inclined I heartily recommend having a play.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.pezholio.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/openlylocal.jpg" alt="openlylocal">As a lot of you probably know, I&#x2019;m a <a href="http://www.pezholio.co.uk/category/open-data/">big fan of open data</a>, as well as driving innovation and making it easier to share information, it&#x2019;s also a lot of fun.</p>

<p>Now, councils are pretty slow in picking this stuff up, for all sorts of reasons (lack of knowledge / interest, lack of technical skills, as well as a lack of direction from anywhere higher up), so most platforms that require local government data are built on &#x2018;screen scraping&#x2019; websites for data - it&#x2019;s a long and laborious technique that you have to repeat for (almost) every single website.</p>

<p><a href="http://openlylocal.com/">Openly Local</a> is one site which does that - a gargantuan effort of <a href="http://twitter.com/countculture">just one man</a>, which takes councillor and council meeting data from a number of different council websites and puts it all together. Not only does it put the information in a web-based format for us humans to read, it also publishes it in a machine readable format, so anyone who wants to reuse the data can do so much more quickly than screen scraping.</p>

<p>So imagine my joy when it was announced that Staffordshire County Council (the county area that covers Lichfield District Council, the council I work for) were <a href="http://openlylocal.com/councils/95-Staffordshire-County-Council">the latest addition to OpenlyLocal</a> - I&#x2019;ve been looking for a way of putting county councillor&#x2019;s details on our website, but was reluctant to just copy and paste, as phone numbers, addresses etc can change.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lichfielddc.gov.uk/site/custom_scripts/staffscouncillors.php">This is the result</a>, after just a few hours work of parsing the XML that comes out of OpenlyLocal, I&#x2019;ve got all our county councillor&#x2019;s details on the Lichfield District Council website, together with a link to the county website for more detailed information.</p>

<p>It doens&#x2019;t end there either, as well as councillor details, OpenlyLocal also <a href="webcal://openlylocal.com/meetings.ics?council_id=95">publishes iCal feeds</a>, which people can use to subscribe to meetings on their own desktop calendars (although support is a bit janky in Outlook (suprisingly)) - and there&#x2019;s nothing to stop you publishing these links on your own websites, meaning anyone who wants to keep up to date with where and when council meetings are taking place can do so quite easily!</p>

<p>Cool n&#x2019;est-ce pas?</p>

<p>Now, I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;re fed up of me <a href="http://www.pezholio.co.uk/2009/10/one-step-forward-two-steps-back-ernest-marples-and-the-idiocy-of-the-royal-mail/">banging on</a> <a href="http://www.pezholio.co.uk/2009/10/royal-fail-part-2-lets-do-something/">about the Royal Mail</a>, but bare with me, this isn&#x2019;t about postcodes.</p>

<p>Whilst idily surfing around Twitter using <a href="http://www.atebits.com/tweetie-iphone/">Tweetie 2</a> (which is awesome by the way), I thought I&#x2019;d have a look at <a href="">Royal Mail&#x2019;s Twitter account</a> to see if they&#x2019;d had anything to say about the Ernest Marples postcode debacle.</p>

<p>Looking at their account, I noticed that they&#x2019;d favourited a tweet, on closer inspection it appeared to be this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pezholio.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/royalfail.png"><img src="http://www.pezholio.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/royalfail.png" alt="It is written into the CWU constitution that Royal Mail must go on strike once every 4 months. Whiny fucks."></a></p>

<p>Now, correct me if I&#x2019;m wrong, when you favourite a tweet, you&#x2019;re effectively validating the opinion of the tweeter and saying that you agree with it.</p>

<p>This is wholly unprofessional, and to write off the concerns of thousands of workers whose jobs are at risk by calling them &#x2018;whiny fucks&#x2019; is at best, clumsy, and at worst, insensitive - whatever you as an organisation think about the rights and wrongs of them striking.</p>

<p>I&#x2019;m sure this will be attributed to the actions of an <a href="http://www.brandrepublic.com/News/915903/Habitat-blames-Twitter-faux-pas-intern/">over zealous intern</a>, but it really does highlight how you should tread carefully when on Twitter, especially if you&#x2019;re a publicly owned organisation such as the Royal Mail.</p>

<p>I love Wordpress (hell, I use it for my blog don&#x2019;t I?) and for a while I&#x2019;ve been looking for an excuse to add to the community and build a plugin.</p>

<p>Whilst working on a <a href="http://www2.lichfielddc.gov.uk/northlichfield">new community blog for the North Lichfield Initiative</a> I found that excuse.</p>

<p>The guy I was training to update the blog wanted an easy way to show Flickr slideshows on posts and pages and didn&#x2019;t want to mess around with code. I first tried using <a href="http://www.flickrslideshow.com/">Flickr Slideshow</a>, which generates code to embed Flickr slideshows into websites, but found that the visual editor strips away the iframe code when you publish the post.</p>

<p>I searched and searched through the Wordpress plugins, but couldn&#x2019;t find anything that did what I wanted to do quickly and easily - so I rolled up my sleeves and got my hands dirty!</p>

<p>The result is <a href="http://www.pezholio.co.uk/my-work/flickr-slideshow/">Flickr Flash Slideshow</a> - all you need to do is put the link the to user, set or group you want a slideshow of between [ flickr][ /flickr] tags (without the spaces) like so:</p>

<p>[ flickr]url[ /flickr]</p>

<p>You can also add the width or height of the slideshow like so:</p>

<p>[ flickr]url,width,height[ /flickr]</p>

<p>If the width and height is left out, then the plugin defaults to 300px x 300px</p>

<p>Check out an example here:</p>

<p>[flickr]http://www.flickr.com/groups/894733@N22/[/flickr]</p>

<p>I was amazed by how quickly I could put it together and it&#x2019;s further cemented my belief that Wordpress is one of the best, if not best open source projects ever -  a lot of projects could learn from its ease and extensibility.</p>

<p>Anyways, if you want the plugin, please <a href="/flickr-flash-slideshow.zip">Download it here</a> and let me know if you have any problems! I&#x2019;m sure it&#x2019;ll come in handy for a lot of community based sites who&#x2019;s users may not have enough technical knowledge to edit raw HTML.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I&#x2019;ve finally got access to the Wordpress SVN repository, so you should be able to install it directly from your admin section - just search for &#x2018;Flickr Flash Slideshow&#x2019;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<p>Well, it&#x2019;s two days on from <a href="http://www.ernestmarples.com/blog/">the closure of the Ernestmarples.com service</a>, and I&#x2019;m still hopping mad about it, but, as we know, you can&#x2019;t do much with anger alone, so I&#x2019;ve decided to do two key things to try and move this issue along.</p>

<p>Firstly, inspired by <a href="http://twitter.com/ivebeenlinuxed/status/4628526554">this tweet</a> I decided to start a <a href="http://petitions.number10.gov.uk/nfppostcodes/">petition on the Number 10 website</a> - at the time of writing, it&#x2019;s received 377 signatures and has only been up for 24 hours, so if you haven&#x2019;t signed it, then what are you waiting for? Get on it!</p>

<p>Secondly, I&#x2019;ve written to my local MP, Mike O&#x2019;Brien (via <a href="http://www.writetothem.com/">Writetothem.com</a>) to try and get some attention to the cause (although <a href="http://www.tom-watson.co.uk/2009/10/postcodes-adam-crozier-letter/">Tom Watson will be raising it as an issue in parliament next week</a> - good job Tom!).</p>

<p>The text is below - please don&#x2019;t copy it verbatim (Writetothem block multiple messages with the same content, and besides MPs will generally ignore letters like this), but feel free to use it as inspiration to write to your own MP!</p>

<blockquote><p>Dear Mike O&#x2019;Brien,</p></blockquote>

<p>Ernestmarples.com was a website set up in July with the intention of providing community based, not for profit websites with the ability to extract geographic information (i.e. latitude and longitude) from UK postcodes for free.</p>

<p>This site now been shut down due to legal action from the Royal Mail and, as a result, many useful websites that use the data, including jobcentreproplus.com, planningalerts.com and thestraightchoice.com are no longer functional.</p>

<p>I understand the need for the Royal Mail to make money from this information, but surely an exception can be made for non-profit making, community built websites? We are on the cusp of a public services recession, and surely any attempt to add value to public sector online offerings should be encouraged, not suppressed?</p>

<p>I believe that your colleague Tom Watson MP will be taking this issue up with you and other ministers shortly, but I wanted to add my voice to the argument and make sure you were aware how strongly some of your constituents felt about this issue.</p>

<p>I look forward to hearing your thoughts.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely,</p>

<p>Stuart Harrison</p>

<p>I don&#x2019;t expect change to come overnight (I&#x2019;m a pragmatic fella like that), but I believe the more this issue is raised, the more likely we are to see some form of change at some point in the future (&#x2018;specially with an election coming up!). If you&#x2019;ve got any other bright ideas to get the &#x2018;Ernest question&#x2019; under the noses of the people who matter, or if you&#x2019;ve written to your MP yourself, let me know in the comments!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<p><img src="http://www.pezholio.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Untitled-11.jpg" alt="Royal Fail">Well, it happened. today, the Royal Mail have <a href="http://ernestmarples.com/blog/">issued ernestmarples.com with a takedown notice</a>, demanding that the service be taken down immediately under pain of legal action.</p>

<p>For those of you who don&#x2019;t know, <a href="http://www.ernestmarples.com">Ernest Marples</a> was / is a system that provided not-for-profit sites (such as <a href="http://www.mappage.org/hw/">HealthWhere</a>, <a href="http://jobcentreproplus.com/">JobcentreProPlus.com</a>, <a href="http://www.planningalerts.com">Planning Alerts</a> and, by extension <a href="http://www.twitterplan.co.uk/">Twitterplan</a>) with latitude and longitude data from postcodes, which means that people can get information about their areas with only their postcode.</p>

<p>Because Ernest Marples has been served with this notice, none of these sites can function, meaning the Royal Mail (who are <em>supposed</em> to be a public service)  are directly responsible for taking away a wealth of useful tools from the public it&#x2019;s <em>supposed</em> to serve.</p>

<p>Judging by the <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=royal+mail">flurry of outcry on Twitter</a>, the Royal Mail are not a popular bunch because of this decision, and have really shot themselves in the foot PR wise.</p>

<p>Instead of getting heavy-handed with the lawyers, why didn&#x2019;t they enter with a dialogue with Harry and Richard (the people behind the site) and try and come up with an alternative license for volunteer-built, community focused sites of this nature?</p>

<p>I can sort of understand them wanting to protect their revenue stream (although it&#x2019;s arguable that this data should be in the public domain anyway), but because these sites are built by volunteers and make no money, they aren&#x2019;t going to have the funding to fork out the &#xA3;4k per year to have access to the official postcode database - so the Royal Mail aren&#x2019;t losing out on any extra cash anyway. All they&#x2019;ve done is picked up their ball and gone off in a strop, meaning no one can play anymore.</p>

<p>I&#x2019;m hoping that something can be worked out, because it&#x2019;d be a crying shame if this service (or something similar) didn&#x2019;t get going again.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I&#x2019;ve submitted a <a href="http://petitions.number10.gov.uk/nfppostcodes/">petition to Number 10 about this</a>, not sure how much good it&#x2019;ll do, but it&#x2019;s worth a try! Please sign, retweet, pass around by any means you can!</p>

In case you&#x2019;ve had your head buried in a good few feet of sand, then you&#x2019;ll know all about the <a href="http://www.pezholio.co.uk/2009/09/a-few-thoughts-on-birmingham-city-councils-website/">issues surrounding the new Birmingham City Council website</a>. I won&#x2019;t get into it too much here, but, suffice to say, the project was over budget, late and didn&#x2019;t deliver half of what is expected from a modern .gov.uk website.</p>

<p>We&#x2019;re all aware of over budget government schemes that deliver less than the sum of their parts, but the interesting stuff didn&#x2019;t stop there, in fact, it&#x2019;s only just started - a group of passionate web type people (developers, designers, proofreaders and the like) have got together to build <a href="http://bccdiy.com/">BCC DIY</a>, a site that tries to give the people of Birmingham a better web experience.</p>

<p>As well as scraping the existing content of the original Birmingham City Council site (and publishing it in a wiki format - so people can edit and change at will), it also brings in external tools, such as <a href="http://www.fixmystreet.com/">FixMyStreet</a> and <a href="http://planningalerts.com/">Planning Alerts</a>, so people can see, at a glance, what&#x2019;s going on in their area.</p>

<p>The work really got going last Friday with a <a href="http://bccdiy.eventbrite.com/">hack day up at Moseley Exchange</a> (which I wanted to get to, but sadly car trouble prevented me) where people from across Birmingham (and beyond - <a href="http://al-smith.co.uk/">Al Smith</a> - Newcastle City Council&#x2019;s Web 2.0 guy, made a special trip down for the occasion) got together for a big heave ho to get the project up and running.</p>

<p>The results, while not reflective of a fully formed project (yet), are impressive, and for me, as a local government webbie, really interesting.</p>

<p>While usability studies can tell us a lot, they are often informed by our own ideas and prejudices. BCC DIY shows us the kind of website that people who spend a lot of time on the web (and often work in the sector too) want from a website and gives us a fresh view of local government online.</p>

<p>Obviously, what &#x2018;web people&#x2019; want from a website may well be different from what less web savvy people want, but it&#x2019;s a viewpoint, and one that reflects the views of a lot of our users. I&#x2019;m continuing to watch with interest.</p>

<p>A thought occurred to me when driving to work this morning (&#x2018;cos I&#x2019;m sad like that) about the kinds of services councils need to manage their social media (in particular Twitter) presence well.</p>

<p>This is particularly pertinent with the <a href="http://3ft9.com/10-twitapps-shutting-down">demise of Twitapps</a>, which, amongst other things, allows you to keep tracks of @ replies via email. I&#x2019;ve found this really useful for both my work and personal accounts, and it&#x2019;s going to be a shame when it goes.</p>

<p>I also use a variety of other services, such as <a href="http://hootsuite.com/">Hootsuite</a> and <a href="http://www.socialoomph.com/">Social Oomph</a>, as well as using <a href="http://www.netvibes.com/">Netvibes</a> to see all my RSS Twitter search feeds in one place.</p>

<p>This is a lot of stuff to manage, a lot of places to have passwords, and means I&#x2019;m putting a lot of <a href="http://studioab.wordpress.com/2009/07/22/faith-in-the-cloud-and-the-quest-to-freealncl/">faith in the cloud</a> and it got me thinking, why don&#x2019;t we put all this stuff in one place?</p>

<p>Therefore, I&#x2019;ve put together this post to gauge interest in a &#x2018;one stop shop&#x2019; for councils to manage their social media presence, as well as getting ideas for the kind of stuff that could be introduced - I&#x2019;m thinking mainly Twitter for now because of the flexibility of their API, but we could also bring in other stuff like Facebook, and the <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=f1ae63990f6d5b9e48ce807a77bb9995">social media firehose</a>.</p>

<p>Not only would this make things easier for councils who are already using social media, it would also help many others get on board, who may be intimidated or put off by the sheer amount of things they need to sign up for.</p>

<p>Some of the feature ideas I&#x2019;ve got so far are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>@ reply notification</p></li>
<li><p>New follower management (a sort of semi-auto follow that lists new followers for that day and allows you to pick and choose if you follow back)</p></li>
<li><p>RSS feed management (because we don&#x2019;t live in an ideal world)</p></li>
<li><p>A sort of stripped-down Hootsuite, which allows anyone with a login to tweet or respond to @ replies quickly and easily</p></li>
<li><p>Multiple account management</p></li>
<li><p>Workflow</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I&#x2019;ll add to this list as I think of more and as some are submitted. If this gets off the ground, I&#x2019;ll probably need some developer support too, so if you&#x2019;re well-versed in PHP and the Twitter API and would like to help out, please let me know!</p>

<p>For those of you who don&#x2019;t know, Twitter have recently announced <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2009/09/twitters-new-terms-of-service.html">new terms of service</a>, mainly in an attempt to clear up stuff about who owns your tweets, but also to try and stop the flood of spam.</p>

<p>Now, as someone who hates spam on Twitter with a passion bordering on the psychotic, this is a welcome thing, spam is the scourge of Twitter and really needs a serious effort on the part of Twitter to stamp it out. However, there was on term that piqued my interest:</p>

<blockquote><p>Some of the factors that we take into account when determining what conduct is considered to be spamming are&#x2026; If your updates consist mainly of links, and not personal updates</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, as someone who offers two bot-based services, <a href="http://twitter.com/localgovweb">Localgovweb</a> (which retweets any tweet with the #localgovweb hashtag and has 430 followers) and <a href="http://www.twitterplan.co.uk">Twitterplan</a> (which sends direct messages to users about planning applications in their area), this made me think - are my accounts going to be suspended because they don&#x2019;t offer personal updates?</p>

<p>It also calls into question many council Twitter accounts, which use the &#x2018;fire and forget&#x2019; method of setting up <a href="http://twitterfeed.com/">Twitterfeed</a> to tweet RSS news stories automatically - could they too be in breach of the TOS?</p>

<p>After thinking for a bit, I&#x2019;d probably say no, automated accounts are only likely to be suspended if you indulge in other types of spammy behaviour (such as mass following, spam complaints, a large number of blocks etc), so as long as you aren&#x2019;t doing this, you <em>should</em> be OK.</p>

<p>However, if you do run a bot, it might be worth reconsidering how you use Twitter - yes, automatic updates can be useful, but consider breaking up the automatic feeds with more personal updates - is there an event happening in your area that you might not have done a press release about? Or has someone tweeted something about the council that you&#x2019;d like to respond to?</p>

<p>Peppering your updates with personal stuff of this nature makes the council seem more open and more approachable (if you need some inpiration, check out <a href="http://twitter.com/walsallcouncil">Walsall Council&#x2019;s tweets</a>). Behaving like a robot is just going to make your organisation seem like just that, a robot.</p>
