  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<p>I&#x2019;m probably late on this, but, courtesy of a <a href="http://particitech.ning.com/profiles/blogs/edusec-1">blog post from Mr Fraser Henderson</a>, I&#x2019;ve spotted <a href="http://uk.ratemyteachers.com/">Rate My Teachers</a>, a crowdsourced site that allows kids to, as the name suggests, rate their teachers.</p>

<p>Pupils get the opportunity to rate their teachers based on easiness, helpfulness, clarity and popularity, as well as give a bit of a comment on the teacher themselves.</p>

<p>After posting up on Twitter about this, <a href="http://twitter.com/pauloCanning/statuses/1948306411">@paulocanning pointed out that it wasn&#x2019;t well-liked by teachers, and it&#x2019;s blocked by most school web filters</a>. I can kind of see their reasoning, but I think schools are missing a trick.</p>

<p>OK, yeah, kids can sometimes be cruel, but sometimes, they can also have insight and, at the end of the day (as much as schools might claim otherwise), they&#x2019;re receiving a service. Why not embrace this technology (and moderate it, the site gives people the opportunity to apply to be moderators) and give pupils the opportunity to give feedback on the service they receive? Obviously, you&#x2019;ll get a few nasty comments, but these can be deleted by the moderator.</p>

<p>And, besides, even if Rate my teachers is blocked at school, (<a href="http://twitter.com/pigsonthewing/statuses/1948335998">as pointed out by @pigsonthewing</a>) kids have internet at home and on their mobile phones, so what&#x2019;s to stop them using those channels? Why not embrace it, rather than ignore it and (shock, horror!) treat the kids like adults? You&#x2019;ll get the kind of insight and feedback that a million school inspectors couldn&#x2019;t provide.</p>

<p>(It&#x2019;d be nice if it had an API though)</p>

<p><img src="http://www.pezholio.co.uk/images/bird.jpg" alt="">Today marks a coming together (if you&#x2019;re an idiot, you might call it a synergy), of all the obsessions I&#x2019;ve blogged about so far - Planning Applications, APIs and Twitter. It&#x2019;s called <a href="http://www.twitterplan.co.uk/">TwitterPlan</a>, and it allows you to receive alerts of planning applications in your area via Twitter.</p>

<p>It uses the <a href="http://www.planningalerts.com/apihowto.php">Planning Alerts API</a> and sends DMs (direct messages) every time a planning application is listed. Most UK local authorities are covered, but if your council isn&#x2019;t covered you&#x2019;ll start receiving alerts as soon as one of the Planning Alerts community build a screen scraper for your council.</p>

<p>It&#x2019;s still in Alpha stage at the moment (that is, it&#x2019;s still under development), but I&#x2019;d like as many people signed up as possible so I can test the functionality and get feedback on how you&#x2019;d like the project to move forward.</p>

<p>Many thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/abeeken">@abeeken</a> at City of Lincoln council and <a href="http://twitter.com/michaeldpollard">@MichaelDPollard</a> for helping me overcome my lack of confidence in the design side of things and beautifying the site with the design and birdy character. Thanks also to <a href="http://www.memespring.co.uk/">Richard Pope</a> from Planning Alerts for his advice and feedback. I couldn&#x2019;t have done it withoutcha guys!</p>

<p>So what are you waiting for? <a href="http://www.twitterplan.co.uk">Get signed up!</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<p>With the increasing popularity of Twitter and the like, it&#x2019;s becoming more and more important to keep those characters down with URL shortening services such as <a href="http://is.gd">is.gd</a>, <a href="http://cli.gs">cli.gs</a> and of course, the ubiquitous <a href="http://tinyurl.com">TinyURL</a></p>

<p>A lot of these services offer <a href="http://www.pezholio.co.uk/tag/api/">APIs</a>, taking a long url and returning the short url. But a lot of these are returned in JSON or XML format, meaning that you have to use a lot of extra time and processing power parsing the output to get the URL, and if you want to do that a lot of times, that&#x2019;s a whole lot of extra strain on your server.</p>

<p>However, TinyURL has an ace up it&#x2019;s sleeve, a (as far as I can see) undocumented API, which adheres the the principle of KISS design. It just returns your shortened URL in plain text. The format is as follows:</p>

<p><code>http://tinyurl.com/api-create.php?url=**[URL here]**</code></p>

<p>We can then have a nice simple PHP function that takes our URL as the input and returns the TinyURL like so:</p>

<p><code>
function tinyurl($url) {
$url = "http://tinyurl.com/api-create.php?url=" . $url;
$tinyurl = file_get_contents($url);
return $tinyurl;
}
</code></p>

<p>Simple, n&#x2019;est ce pas?</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>I&#x2019;ve just noticed that is.gd offer a <a href="http://is.gd/api_info.php">similarly simple API</a>, so to get an even shorter URL, simply replace the tinyurl element with:</p>

<p><code>http://is.gd/api.php?longurl=</code></p>

<p>Da da! Your very own is.gd link!</p>

<p>Just a quick post to get a bit of knowledge out there about <a href="http://petitions.number10.gov.uk/freepaf/">this here petition</a> on the Number 10 website.</p>

<p>For years, the Royal Mail (a company which we (being the taxpayer) are the majority shareholders of) have been the sole custodians of something called the PAF (postcode address file), which, amongst other things, links postcode data to geographical location.</p>

<p>The Royal Mail charge for the use of this information, which means that, often, fantastic location based web services are impossible to run without paying huge sums of money to the Royal Mail.</p>

<p>In the US and other countries, this information has been free of charge to everyone, meaning that anyone can build great location-based mashups with nothing more than a list of addresses.</p>

<p>It&#x2019;s a real shame that we can&#x2019;t do the same thing in the UK, and it&#x2019;s an even bigger shame that it&#x2019;s a publicly-run body (that, let&#x2019;s not forget, uses public money to gather that data) that&#x2019;s stopping us doing this. It&#x2019;s even more maddening that other public sector organisations have to use taxpayer&#x2019;s money to get this data.</p>

<p>So, yes, while Number 10 petitions have a track record of never achieving anything but a condescending response from Gordon Brown&#x2019;s PR team, I think it&#x2019;s important that we just give it a try. It&#x2019;s even more timely as the recent <a href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/reports/power_of_information.aspx">Power of Information Taskforce Report</a> mentioned that if organisations such as the Royal Mail et al opened up their datasets, the loss in revenue would be counter-balanced by the gain in tax revenue from new startups utilising this data.</p>

<p>So go on, <a href="http://petitions.number10.gov.uk/freepaf/">give it a crack</a>, you have nothing to lose but two minutes of your time!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<p><img src="http://www.pezholio.co.uk/images/twitterbird.jpg" alt="">Since my council got a bit of coverage for our usage of Twitter for planning applications, both in the <a href="http://www.planningresource.co.uk/news/ByDiscipline/Development-Control/881934/Twitter-revolution-reaches-planning-world/">specialist press</a> and <a href="http://socitm.gov.uk/socitm/Library/Better+Connected+2009.htm">SOCITM&#x2019;s Better Connected report</a>, I&#x2019;ve received a few calls from other councils who haven&#x2019;t yet got on the Twitter train asking for a bit of advice.</p>

<p>Therefore, in the spirit of sharing, and, being a sharing caring kind of a guy anyway, I thought I&#x2019;d stick some of the advice I&#x2019;ve already given up here too. Feel free to share some of your experiences (or tell me I&#x2019;m completely wrong and a massive idiot) in the comments section as well.</p>

<h2>Posting your tweets</h2>

<p>Twitter is about so much more than just the main Twitter website, in fact, most people who use Twitter on a regular basis barely touch the main Twitter site. They use a combination of tools, from widgets on start pages (such as <a href="http://www.netvibes.com">Netvibes</a>), to Desktop clients (such as <a href="http://www.twhirl.org/">Twhirl</a> and <a href="http://www.tweetdeck.com/">Tweetdeck</a>) and mobile applications (such as <a href="http://twitterfon.net/">Twitterfon</a> on the iPhone and <a href="http://www.orangatame.com/products/twitterberry/">Twitterberry</a> on the Blackberry.</p>

<p>There are also other sites that let you tweet from them and offer a wide range of  extra features that the main Twitter site does not. Our council use <a href="http://hootsuite.com/">Hootsuite</a> which, as well as giving multiple usernames for one Twitter account (which avoids the risk of giving the password to the main account away to many people), also lets you track the amount of clicks a link you send gets, which is useful if you want to measure the success of your twittering.</p>

<h2>Feed your account</h2>

<p>As well as tools for live tweeting, you can also automate your tweets. If your site has an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_(file_format">RSS feed</a>), you can use a tool like <a href="">Twitterfeed</a> to automatically post a tweet every time that feed is updated. For example, if you have a news RSS feed, every time a news article is added to the site, Twitterfeed sends out a tweet. This is the process we used for <a href="http://twitter.com/ldcplanning">@ldcplanning</a> for planning applications. Also, if you have multiple RSS feeds (say, for jobs, planning applications, events etc), you can add those, differentiating between them with a prefix (i.e. &#x2018;New job:&#x2019; or &#x2018;New events:&#x2019;)</p>

<p>Now, a little health warning here, this really shouldn&#x2019;t be your only method of using Twitter, it&#x2019;s all about conversation, and if you&#x2019;re only broadcasting messages, then really, you&#x2019;re not using Twitter to its full potential.</p>

<h2>Following and being followed</h2>

<p>Following is at the heart of Twitter, every time you follow someone, you&#x2019;ll be able to see their updates when you log into Twitter. Every time you get a new follower, you&#x2019;ll receive an email letting you know that they are following you, you can then check out their profile, and take a view on whether you want to follow back. Generally it&#x2019;s considered good manners to follow back regardless, but personally, I only follow back if the person who is following me seems like they might have something interesting to say.</p>

<p>I used to take a similar selective approach with the council account, only following people who were from the local area, but when you get a number of followers every day, that can be time consuming.</p>

<p>I now use a tool called <a href="http://www.tweetlater.com/">Tweetlater</a>, which automates this process for you, every time someone follows you, you automatically follow back. You can also opt to send them an automated direct message (a personal message only they can see), but most people I&#x2019;ve encountered on Twitter (including me) find them irritating and intrusive, so, unless you&#x2019;ve got a very good reason for doing this, erm, don&#x2019;t!</p>

<h2>Search</h2>

<p>Twitter really comes into its own when the search comes into play. <a href="http://search.twitter.com">search.twitter.com </a>allows you to search across the Twitterverse in real time for things that people are tweeting about.</p>

<p>This can prove to be really valuable, as many councils have found out, for example, if you search for your council name and find someone is complaining about the council, you can take a proactive approach and offer to sort out their problem via @ reply. If they give you more information, you can contact them by direct message, sort out their problem and hey presto! a hacked-off resident becomes an engaged resident, who will hopefully go off and tell all their friends how great your council are (that&#x2019;s the theory anyway!)</p>

<p>Now, obviously, as a council, you&#x2019;re not going to be monitoring Twitter 24/7, so there&#x2019;s a couple of ways that you can make this process easier. Firstly, you can monitor a search, either by subscribing to a search&#x2019;s RSS feed or using <a href="http://tweetgrid.com/">Tweetgrid</a>, which allows you to &#x2018;follow&#x2019; searches.</p>

<p>You can also subscribe to a nifty service (called, handily enough, <a href="http://twitapps.com/replies/">Replies</a>), which sends you an email every time someone sends you an @ reply. Again, this makes monitoring Twitter just that little bit easier.</p>

<p>Phew! And I think that&#x2019;s about it! I&#x2019;ve learnt a lot about Twitter since setting up <a href="http://twitter.com/ldcplanning">@ldcplanning</a> in August of last year, and, really, I&#x2019;m still learning. It might seem a lot to take in, but once you get into it, it&#x2019;s really not that difficult. There&#x2019;s also a great, <a href="http://twittgroups.com/group/localgovweb">helpful community of local government people on Twitter</a>, so dive in, follow some people and if you&#x2019;ve got any questions, just ask!</p>

<p>Also, for a bit of a wider view of Twitter, check out <a href="http://twitter.com/bounder">@bounder&#x2019;s</a> guide to <a href="http://www.jonbounds.co.uk/blog/536/twitter-beginners-guide/">Getting Started with Twitter</a>, which gives an overview of Twitter from a less local government-y bent.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<p>It seems that these days you can&#x2019;t move for <a href="http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/the_way_we_live/article5747308.ece">negative press coverage of   Twitter</a>, newspapers love to paint it as a haven of banality where people can   reveal every detail of their pointless existence (of course, when columnists do   it, it&#x2019;s different somehow). They seem to thrive on sneering at it and at anyone who uses Twitter on a daily basis, it&#x2019;s   pretty transparent - they are crapping their pants.</p>

<p>For years now, old media has had the monopoly on news and comment. Even since the days of the internet, people have   still gone to the good ol&#x2019; solid reliable traditional media outlets for their   news, even if it is just their websites. They could ignore (or even buy into)   the worlds of MySpace and Facebook because they are walled gardens where friends   talk amongst friends and generally don&#x2019;t talk about much of   importance.</p>

<p>Twitter, however, is different. The walls that were there in the old days   have been removed (thanks to both Twitter&#x2019;s amazing <a href="http://apiwiki.twitter.com/">API</a> and <a href="http://search.twitter.com/">search</a>) and people don&#x2019;t just follow the   people they know in real life (in fact, I can count on the fingers of one hand   the people I follow on Twitter who I knew before I started using it). Twitter is   a great sounding board - people can fire off opinions about events as they   happen, and even in the case of the Mumbai terrorist attacks and the Denver   plane crash, be on the scene before print   and TV journalists have had time to put their coats on. And the audience is   potentially global.</p>

<p>This amount of eyeballs is gold dust to old school journos, and this is why   they fear Twitter so much. Instead of engaging   with it, they revert to the language of the playground, name calling and   smearing until they&#x2019;re blue in the face. The desperation is   palpable.</p>

<p>However, not all journalists are like this, some, like <a href="http://twitter.com/paulbradshaw">@paulbradshaw</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/joannageary">@joannageary</a> actively engage with   Twitter and see its power. <a href="http://twitter.com/charltonbrooker">@charltonbrooker</a> (A.K.A. Charlie   Brooker, who, amongst other great things, writes a couple of columns for the   Guardian) has been experimenting with Twitter, gathering opinions from Twitter   users to use in his columns and posting &#x2018;teaser&#x2019; content.</p>

<p>These are just a few examples of journalists who are going in the right   direction, there are loads more bright, intelligent, switched on media types who are seeing Twitter and other new   web tools as an opportunity, not a threat. If the nay sayers carry on deriding   Twitter and claiming to see it as an irrelevance, they&#x2019;re going to be the ones   who effectively sign their own P45s.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<p>After much, uhming, ahing and &#x201C;what are the roads like&#x201D;ing I finally dragged myself out of the house and down the snowy roads of east Birmingham, the roads were fine until I got out of Solihull, but that&#x2019;s another story.</p>

<p>I arrived at the venue (The Blues ground, which would horrify my Villa-supporting in-laws) expecting to see an empty room, but people had clearly made the effort and it was pretty darn busy. Saw plenty of tweeple (hello <a href="http://twitter.com/StevenTuck">@StevenTuck</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/pigsonthewing">@pigsonthewing</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/mafjohnson">@mafjohnson</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/simonwakeman">@simonwakeman</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/podnosh">@podnosh</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/bounder">@bounder</a> (and his alter-ego <a href="http://twitter.com/jonbounds">@jonbounds</a>) as well as some of my compadres from the <a href="http://staffordshirewebmasters.pbwiki.com/">Staffordshire Webmasters&#x2019; group</a> (who <strong>still</strong> aren&#x2019;t on Twitter - sort it out people!)</p>

<p>Anyway, there were some great talks and a <strong>lot</strong> of <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23lgcommsnm">live tweeting</a> (the #lgcommsnm hashtag trended on Twitter search half way through the day) and I got a helluva lot out of it.</p>

<p>The main message of the day seemed to be <a href="http://twitter.com/jonbounds/statuses/1179736337">not to underestimate the time needed to spend on social media</a> and this is something I echo wholeheartedly. In fact, at the conference I had to log into my work account and <a href="http://twitter.com/Lichfield_DC/statuses/1179352813">tweet about leisure centre closures</a> and I&#x2019;m making it a priority to get some of the comms team using the work Twitter account (via <a href="http://hootsuite.com/">HootSuite</a> (formerly BrightKit)) so if I&#x2019;m away, or get run over by a bus, the Twitter account still remains active!</p>

<p>We missed a few presentations due to the snow and other reasons (I was especially looking forward to Graham Jones&#x2019;s presentation, but the slides are coming up online I&#x2019;ve been told), but I think many more would&#x2019;ve been information overload.</p>

<p>The Home Office team showing how they used <a href="http://www.bebo.com">Bebo</a> in an <a href="http://www.bebo.com/itdoesnthavetohappen">anti-knife crime initiative</a> was particularly interesting. The use of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGYx41VgHUg">viral video</a> (don&#x2019;t click if you&#x2019;re eating!) was really cool too. A few people had concerns about the cost of the campaign (it cost around &#xA3;2 million over 3 years), but it&#x2019;s worth bearing in mind that this was a national campaign, so the costs are bound to be higher. A Bebo-led campaign for a local authority can be done on a shoestring.</p>

<p>It also made me think that maybe we&#x2019;re using the wrong channels for social media. At the moment, we shy away from Bebo, purely because it&#x2019;s difficult to use and glitchy, preferring Facebook, but should we really not use a social network just because we don&#x2019;t like it? (after all <a href="http://twitter.com/pezholio/statuses/1179442588">Bebo is the top Social Media destination for 7-16 year olds</a> (Facebook doesn&#x2019;t even appear in the top 20!))</p>

<p>Another statistic that I&#x2019;ll take home with me came from Jeremy Redhouse from <a href="http://redhouselane.co.uk/">Redhouse Lane</a> who said that we retain 50% of what we see, and 70% of what we discuss, and video is a great way to generate discusssion. Specifically video created by <a href="http://redhouselane.co.uk/">Redhouse Lane</a>, but he&#x2019;s not running a charity, so I understand why he had to give the big plug</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/simonwakeman">Simon Wakeman&#x2019;s</a> talk on lessons learnt from new / social media was great too, showing that engagement via social media can <a href="http://en-gb.facebook.com/group.php?gid=21822820530">sometimes have dire consequences</a> - I think sometimes people forget that social media can have consequences in the real world.</p>

<p>Nice to see Merlin Sinclair take it back to the basics with his talk about how he and his team redeveloped the <a href="http://www.westminster.gov.uk/">Westminster City Council website</a> (even though he did <a href="http://twitter.com/pezholio/statuses/1179762728">slag off Twitter</a> - the swine!), but as <a href="http://twitter.com/PSFbuzz">@PSFBuzz</a> tweeted during the presentation, new media doesn&#x2019;t always have to be about &#x2018;web 2.0&#x2019;.</p>

<p>Scott Wilson from Essex talked about a campaigning approach to social media, they&#x2019;ve had a couple of campaigns on Facebook against <a href="http://www.facebook.com/search_redirect.php?q=stansted,airport&amp;fc=0&amp;gc=0&amp;cl=300&amp;rc=127&amp;rank=25&amp;friends=0&amp;sns=0&amp;sf=p&amp;init=s:quick&amp;cururl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fs.php%3Fsid%3De3574d06cb9a8e2dc9835786a0af5620%26init%3Dq%26sf%3Dp%26k%3D200000010%26n%3D-1%26q%3Dstansted%2Bairport%26o%3D4%26s%3D20&amp;is_friend=&amp;sid=e3574d06cb9a8e2dc9835786a0af5620&amp;num_uq=1&amp;id=2234545469&amp;o_type=2&amp;rid=0&amp;ab=X&amp;t=c:name&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fgroup.php%3Fgid%3D2234545469">a second runway at Stanstead Airport</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=6672761620">against Post Office Closures</a>. He also talked about monitoring social networks and engaging with negative campaigns, which they did with an anti-speed camera group (again on Facebook, can&#x2019;t find the link!).</p>

<p>Nick Booth (a.k.a <a href="http://twitter.com/podnosh">@podnosh</a>) was next up, talking about various ways that the web has changed democracy for the better, including the great work that some of the Birmingham Bloggers have been doing with <a href="http://bigcitytalk.org.uk/">Big City Plan Talk</a> - a plain English and easy to use version of Birmingham City Council&#x2019;s <a href="http://bigcityplan.birmingham.gov.uk/">Big City Plan consultation</a>*, as well as the <a href="http://www.mysociety.org/projects/theyworkforyou/">brilliant</a> <a href="http://www.mysociety.org/projects/fixmystreet/">stuff</a> <a href="http://www.mysociety.org/projects/whatdotheyknow/">that</a> <a href="http://www.mysociety.org/projects/writetothem/">MySociety</a> <a href="http://www.mysociety.org/projects/groupsnearyou/">do</a>.</p>

<p>I had a bit of a rant afterwards about building <a href="http://www.pezholio.co.uk/?p=31">APIs</a> not being hard - this wasn&#x2019;t a dig at councils by the way, more a dig at suppliers who like to lock data away in horrible unusable systems.</p>

<p>Mark Hansen from <a href="http://www.labourhome.org/">Labourhome</a> rounded things off nicely, talking about how the group had helped bring the Labour Party kicking and screaming into the world of social media, he mentioned about not stifling debate, which I think is crucial if you&#x2019;re going to have any kind of credibility on the web (no point only publishing comments that agree with your agenda :cough<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk">dailymail</a>cough:), as well as the various other methods the party have used to get social online.</p>

<p>All in all, it was a great day, a good opportunity to learn about other people&#x2019;s experiences with social media and also a marvellous networking opportunity. Cheers to all at <a href="http://www.lgcomms.org.uk/">LGCommunications</a> for putting it all together!</p>

<ul>
<li>Actually, the <a href="http://bigcityplan.birmingham.gov.uk/">Big City Plan website</a> itself isn&#x2019;t bad, it&#x2019;s fully accessible, user tested and uses microformats, it&#x2019;s the actual consultation bit that&#x2019;s the problem. Once again another example of departments not listening to the experts and just plumping for an off the shelf solution. Sigh.</li>

<p><img src="http://www.pezholio.co.uk/images/api.gif" alt="A nice little api icon on a wet floor. As you do.">Well, it&#x2019;s was a busy old day for me yesterday, sitting in the warm at home and establishing myself in the blogosphere, and I&#x2019;ve been blown away by how much traffic my last post attracted. It was one of the commenters on my last post (<a href="http://martinrstone.wordpress.com/">Martin Stone</a>) who inspired me to post today. He said:</p>

<blockquote><p>Great stuff&#x2026; do you know of any other government apis available as feeds like the planning alert? Perhaps we (you) could start a list.</p></blockquote>

<p>And, as requested, I have! I&#x2019;ve quickly <a href="http://www.pezholio.co.uk/localgovapi/">hacked up a list</a> that feeds all the links to APIs that have been tagged &#x2018;localgovapi&#x2019; from social bookmarking site <a href="http://www.delicious.com">delicious</a> (Using a similar method that the DIUS uses for its <a href="http://sandbox.dius.gov.uk/digitalgovuk/">digitalgovuk</a> list). There&#x2019;s a fair few links there already, but I&#x2019;m sure there&#x2019;s plenty of stuff I&#x2019;ve missed.</p>

<p><strong>This is where you, dear reader, come in</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.pezholio.co.uk/localgovapi/">Take a look at the list</a>, and if there&#x2019;s anything I&#x2019;ve missed, <a href="http://www.delicious.com">jump on delicious</a> (<a href="https://secure.delicious.com/register">start an account</a> if you haven&#x2019;t already) and tag any links with the tag &#x2018;localgovapi&#x2019;. Through the magic of PHP and the <a href="http://simplepie.org/">Simple Pie library</a>, my page will pick it up! It&#x2019;s quite hacky at the moment, and, depending on the success of the feature, I might make some amendments.</p>

<p>APIs are a great and very powerful way for councils and government departments to share information, be it with other government organisations, or just your <a href="http://rewiredstate.org/">average Joe Blogs web developer</a>.</p>

<p>I&#x2019;m so convinced of their power, <a href="http://www.ratemyplace.org.uk/newsite/api.php">I&#x2019;ve built one myself</a>. I&#x2019;m also dead excited about the work that DirectGov are planning with <a href="http://innovate.direct.gov.uk/">innovate.direct.gov.uk</a>, so it&#x2019;d be great to see more examples &#x2018;in the wild&#x2019; as it were.</p>

<p>As always, any comments, questions etc, let me know!</p>
