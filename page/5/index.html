<p>It&#x2019;s called &#x2018;The Hydrogen Bomb&#x2019; and (I assume) is from the early 50&#x2019;s - some of the artwork is fantastic (especially the oh-so-helpful diagram telling you to sit under the stairs) and it&#x2019;s a prime example of the &#x2018;keep calm and carry on&#x2019; ethos of the post war era.</p>

<p>&#x2018;Cos I&#x2019;m nice, I&#x2019;ve scanned it and uploaded it for yis - and you can <a href="http://www.pezholio.co.uk/nuclear.pdf">download it here</a>.</p>

<p>We also came across a few tourism brochures from about the same period, which we&#x2019;re hoping to get uploaded and scanned to the council site - my favourite bit is <a href="http://www.twitpic.com/h6n22">this advert, advertising the local area&#x2019;s cheap and abundant supply of electricity</a>. Ah, the good old days!</p>

<p><strong>Health warning</strong></p>

<p>Before I go any further, it&#x2019;s worth pointing out that my views are my own, and not the views of my employer - just so you know like.</p>

<p>Well, it&#x2019;s finally happened - massively over budget, and over three years late, <a href="http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/">Birmingham City Council&#x2019;s website</a> has finally launched.</p>

<p>And what a disappointment it is, admittedly it&#x2019;s an improvement from the old site, which looked like it had crawled out of the mid-90s, but already looks a bit dated - there&#x2019;s no RSS feeds (apart from feeds for searches - automatically generated by the Google search appliance) and there&#x2019;s a <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=+%23bccwebsite">myriad of other problems</a>.</p>

<p>Birmingham is the second largest local authority in the UK, has a thriving digital community, and the local authority is doing great stuff with <a href="http://www.digitalbirmingham.co.uk/">Digital Birmingham</a>, so why isn&#x2019;t this reflected in the city council&#x2019;s website?</p>

<p>Manchester, a similar sized authority, launched their <a href="http://www.manchester.gov.uk/">new website</a> in a fraction of the time it took to launch Birmingham&#x2019;s, also scooping a <a href="http://www.btonlineexcellence.com/winners.php">BT online excellence award</a> in the process, proving that it doesn&#x2019;t take an age to launch a website for a large local authority.</p>

<p>Now, I don&#x2019;t blame the web team for this, they&#x2019;ve done a very good job given using the tools they&#x2019;ve been given, but the problem is the system it&#x2019;s been built on - by all accounts the web team have had very little involvement and most of the grunt work has been done by the council&#x2019;s outsourced IT &#x2018;partner&#x2019; <a href="http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/cs/Satellite?c=Page&amp;childpagename=Service-Birmingham%2FPageLayout&amp;cid=1223092749116&amp;pagename=BCC%2FCommon%2FWrapper%2FWrapper">Service Birmingham</a> - operated by everyone&#x2019;s favourite outsourcer Capita (or Crapita if you read Private Eye).</p>

<p>Not involving the people who know best - the web team - in the first place means not only do you have a system which is massively over budget and more than fashionably late, it also means that you have a site that doesn&#x2019;t represent Birmingham in a positive light.</p>

<p>Effectively getting an IT outsourcer - who&#x2019;s expertise is not in the domain of web - is a fatal error - it&#x2019;s akin to getting a printer to publish a newspaper - they may know about printing, but what do they know about journalism? Obviously there is an overlap, but IT and web are, in main, separate disciplines and this needs to be respected.</p>

<p>Now, my good friend Paul Canning has been <a href="http://paulcanning.blogspot.com/2009/05/postscript-why-gov-webbies-need.html">banging on about more respect for government webbies for a while</a>, arguing that we need professional status, and this is a textbook example of why this desperately needs to happen, otherwise we&#x2019;re going to end up with more disasters of this nature.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<p>Just a quick one here while I think about it. I&#x2019;ve recently noticed there&#x2019;s a new kid on the corporate Twitter block, and they&#x2019;re not learning from the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8116869.stm">mistakes Habitat made earlier this year</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lloydspharmacy.com">Lloyds Pharmacy</a> (who have two locations on my High Street alone) have recently set up on Twitter and, <a href="http://www.lloydspharmacy.com/wps/portal/aboutus/aboutlloydspharmacy">judging by the spiel on their website</a>, they&#x2019;re keen on primary care and offering health services (sometimes for free) to local communities. They&#x2019;ve been using Twitter, therefore, to spread health messages as well as plug their own brand.</p>

<p>However, they&#x2019;re doing this wrong. Instead of promoting their presence on Twitter, following a few people here and there and building up a natural following, they&#x2019;re going with the scattergun approach, automatically sending out a tweet like this every time someone, whether they&#x2019;re following or not, mentions the word &#x2018;holiday&#x2019;:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.pezholio.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/lloyds.jpeg" alt="lloyds"></p>

<p> Obviously a lot of users are annoyed by this, it&#x2019;s intrusive and spammy and certainly goes against the whole community-based, fluffy image that Lloyds tries to portray - I <a href="http://twitter.com/pezholio/statuses/3445389928">sent them a tweet</a> to this effect, but obviously they&#x2019;re not listening (again, a major no no in the world of corporate twittering). This just shows a major lack of research, making it seem like someone&#x2019;s heard about Twitter and gone out on their own, without doing any research into what&#x2019;s acceptable and what&#x2019;s not acceptable - very much like what happened with Habitat&#x2019;s &#x2018;intern&#x2019;, who used trending topics to try and get Habitat&#x2019;s tweets visible in Twitter&#x2019;s search.</p>

<p>I&#x2019;m all for learning, and I&#x2019;d like to think Lloyds will realise what they&#x2019;re doing is wrong, and go back to the drawing board, trying to understand more about what is and what isn&#x2019;t acceptable on Twitter, but I&#x2019;m not holding out any hope.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<p>Well, it looks like I&#x2019;m going to break a record, two blog posts in one week, aren&#x2019;t you lucky people? Well, this blog post, as the title suggests, is about last night&#x2019;s data mashups and APIs event in Brum, hosted by the <a href="http://www.birminghamsmc.com/">Birmingham Social Media Cafe</a> peeps at the lovely and awesome and oh-mi-god-i-wish-i-worked-there <a href="http://modx-fazeley.spring-php.com/">Fazeley Studios</a>.</p>

<p>The evening was a laid back affair, with noms and drinks laid on by <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/">The Guardian</a> (who are pretty much leading the way in open data for newspapers) and consisted of talks by Dave Harte from <a href="http://www.digitalbirmingham.co.uk/">Digital Birmingham</a>, Michael Brunton-Spal from the Guardian, Matthew Somerville (sometime of <a href="http://www.mysociety.org/">MySociety</a> and sometimes just his <a href="http://www.dracos.co.uk/">own darn self</a>) and Paul Bradshaw, Senior Lecturer in Online Journalism at <a href="http://www.bcu.ac.uk/">Birmingham City University</a>.</p>

<p>The focus of the evening was really for the presenters to showcase what they were doing with open data, whether that&#x2019;s sourcing and generating it themselves, or using data from other sources to do cool stuff.</p>

<p>The first speaker was Dave Harte from Digital Birmingham, which is a partnership initiative, set up by Birmingham City Council to encourage people in Birmingham to make use of digital technologies. The main focus of Dave&#x2019;s presentation was to discuss the work Digital Birmingham have been doing to get more council data into the public domain.</p>

<p>It&#x2019;s been a softly softly approach so far, very different from my <a href="http://www.lichfielddc.gov.uk/data">JFDI approach at Lichfield</a>, basically consisting of a two pronged approach &#x2013; finding out what people&#x2019;s concerns are (partly though the <a href="http://podnosh.com/blog/tag/brumsms/">social media surgeries</a> being run across the city), and then getting the data based on that, as well as introducing people who don&#x2019;t do the &#x2018;ooh shiny!&#x2019; routine to the concept of open data, partly through <a href="http://www.bevocal.org.uk">bevocal.org.uk</a>.</p>

<p>He also talked about the barriers to open data, such as &#x2018;data hugging&#x2019; (which <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/tim_berners_lee_on_the_next_web.html">Tim Berners Lee talks about in his TED talk</a> &#x2013; a must watch if you haven&#x2019;t seen it already), as well as licensing issues (such as Ordnance Survey) which prevent data being used freely.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/daveharte/timely-information-to-citizens-innovations-in-engaging-citizens-with-service-design-and-delivery-1882209">Dave&#x2019;s presentation can be seen in full here</a></p>

<p>Next up was Michael Brunton-Spal (<a href="http://twitter.com/mibgames">@mibgames</a>) from the lovely sponsors of the day &#x2013; <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/">The Guardian</a>, who have a fantastic store of open data, sourced by journalists and then shared with the general public to mash up and use as they wish.</p>

<p>As well as the Data Store, Michael talked about the work they did with MPs expenses earlier in the year. The Daily Telegraph had the full, unredacted expenses data before the Guardian, and had leigions of interns rifling through it looking for good stories, so the Guardian had to find some way to find stories first.</p>

<p>The solution here was crowdsourcing, they <a href="http://mps-expenses.guardian.co.uk/">published the data online</a> and got interested people to sift through it for them. So far 205,924 pages of documents have been reviewed, and they&#x2019;re only half way through. Interest has dwindled a little since the story first broke, but people are still going through it, looking for interesting titbits.</p>

<p>Michael also went into a bit more detail about the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/data-store">data store</a>, which I mentioned earlier, showing off some of the great stuff that people have done with Guardian data (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/1115946@N24/">there&#x2019;s a gallery on Flickr here</a>) - my favourite one is the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25541021@N00/3791679186/">mashup of media scare stories plotted against the actual deaths the scare caused</a>. There&#x2019;s also lots of cool datasets and examples of what people have done on the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog">Data blog</a>.</p>

<p>Another good mashup was the <a href="http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/maps/mpTravelExpensesMap.html">MP&#x2019;s travel expenses map</a>, which plotted the amount of money claimed by an MP to their constituency, Mps which lived closer to Westminster, but claimed more can be seen very clearly and their claims questioned in more detail.</p>

<p>The coolest thing though in my opinion was the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/open-platform">Guardian Open Platform</a>, which in in closed beta at the moment, this allows anyone to use Guardian stories and features on their own site. There aren&#x2019;t too many examples in the wild at the moment,  but it&#x2019;s certainly something to watch, especially for hyperlocal sites who want to add extra content to their own sites, but don&#x2019;t have the resources.</p>

<p>The next speaker was Matthew Somerville (<a href="http://twitter.com/dracos">@dracos</a>), who talked about some of the work he&#x2019;s been doing on his own, as well as the work he&#x2019;s done with <a href="http://www.mysociety.org.uk">MySociety</a>.</p>

<p>The first thing he talked about was <a href="http://scenic.mysociety.org/">Scenic or Not</a> which is basically a <a href="http://www.hotornot.com/">Hot or Not </a>for views around the UK &#x2013; you&#x2019;re confronted with a randomly selected photo, which you then rate for its prettiness or otherwise. Now, I&#x2019;ve got to admit, I was pretty clueless as to what use this would have when I first heard about it on the MySociety mailing list, but the use of this data literally made my jaw drop.</p>

<p>Once there was enough data gathered, it was then fed in to <a href="http://mapumental.channel4.com/">Mapumental</a>, a system set up by MySociety with Channel 4. At the moment the system allows you to work out your daily commute, but more datasets will be added as time goes on. The video below can show you better than I can explain, so check it out:</p>

<p>At the moment, Mapumental is in private beta (it takes a hell of a lot of processing power to generate those maps!), but you can be put on the waiting list for an invite on the <a href="http://mapumental.channel4.com/signup">Mapumental site</a>.</p>

<p>Matthew then went on to talk about <a href="http://theyworkforyou.com/">TheyWorkForYou</a>, which scrapes Hansard (the parliamentary record) to record what Mps are talking about in the house of commons, as well as other useful stuff. This allows you to keep tabs on what your local MP is talking about, as well as their voting record, their attendance etc etc (<a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/mike_o%27brien/north_warwickshire">you can see an example for my MP &#x2013; Mike O-Brien here</a>).</p>

<p>It also turns out that TheyWorkForYou is a better resource than Hansard, a few years back, the team found out that a dead MP (Jim Marshall) had voted in two divisions despite being dead! They ended up having to contact Hansard to notify them of this mistake.</p>

<p>One of Matthew&#x2019;s other projects is the <a href="http://www.dracos.co.uk/play/locating-postboxes/">UK postbox locator</a> - this arose from a Freedom of Information request made by someone for the location of every postbox in the UK. The Royal Mail provided this, but claimed not to have the exact location, Matthew has used this data to put together a crowdsourcing tool. You enter the first part of your postcode, click &#x2018;Go&#x2019;, and then place the postboxes in the correct location. Over 20,000 postboxes are done so far (<a href="http://www.dracos.co.uk/play/locating-postboxes/?pc1=b46">although B46 looks a bit shabby</a> &#x2013; sorry!) - it&#x2019;s a great example of crowdsourcing in action.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://www.dracos.co.uk/talks/dmapi/">Matthew&#x2019;s presentation is now available here</a>.</p>

<p>Finally came Paul Bradshaw (<a href="http://twitter.com/paulbradshaw">@paulbradshaw</a>), who talked very briefly about <a href="http://helpmeinvestigate.com/">Help me Investigate</a> &#x2013; an online tool for people to collaborate in getting information from organisations. It&#x2019;s still in private beta, but already it has gathered a load of useful data, from the <a href="http://helpmeinvestigate.com/investigations/49-when-can-we-expect-a-new-birmingham-gov-website">cost of the Birmingham City Council website</a> (staggeringly high &#x2013; although it ain&#x2019;t the web team&#x2019;s fault)  to <a href="http://helpmeinvestigate.com/investigations/36-on-which-birmingham-streets-are-the-most-parking-tickets-issued">where parking tickets are issued the most in Birmingham</a>. This is pretty inspiring stuff, and along with <a href="http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/">What Do They Know</a> (which is responsible for 10% of all Freedom of Information requests made) is a great way of getting public data out there, using the stick, rather than the carrot.</p>

<p>Overall, a great evening was had by all (despite the stifling heat!), great pre and post presentation chatter, good food, and most of all free booze! In the spirit of open data, I&#x2019;ve put together a <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0As1cSxPJOFWldFNjUU56TW51R3FFX2xrVi1pUnVFcXc&amp;hl=en">Google Spreadsheet of all the tweets hashtagged #dmapi</a> for you to use as you wish &#x2013; go at it!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<p><img src="http://www.pezholio.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/5025.jpg" alt="One of Lancashire County Council's homepage ads">Recently causing a stir in the online government world has been the new <a href="http://www.lancashire.gov.uk/home/2009/search/index.asp">Lancashire County Council homepage</a>. Basically, it rejects the old school (or should that be &#x2018;old skool&#x2019;?) facets of council homepages, and replaces them with a few links, and a search box. Most of the screen real estate seems to be taken up by a large black and while advert for council services which changes every time you visit it.</p>

<p>It&#x2019;s certainly split the gov Twitterphere into three - some like it, some hate it and some are not convinced. I&#x2019;m firmly in the &#x2018;not convinced&#x2019; camp. I&#x2019;ve been thinking about making our homepage just a simple search for a while now, but I don&#x2019;t think our organisation was ready at the point of the last redesign, so we went for a compromise, with a huge search box at the top of the page to try and encourage searching, as opposed to the traditional navigational route.</p>

<p>With Lancashire however, (which seems to be heavily influenced by <a href="http://www.bing.com/">Bing</a> - Microsoft&#x2019;s attempt at a Google killer) I don&#x2019;t think the search is emphasised enough. Sure, it&#x2019;s outlined in red, but it&#x2019;s very tiny and towards the bottom of the page - I can&#x2019;t see less experienced web users picking up on it. Also, the &#x2018;quick links&#x2019; are hidden at the top right and need to be activated by a click.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.pezholio.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/westminster.jpg" alt="Westminster City Council's Homepage">I much prefer <a href="http://www.westminster.gov.uk/">Westminster&#x2019;s approach</a>, you can&#x2019;t avoid the search box, it&#x2019;s bold, clear and in your face. It&#x2019;s also more service driven, with links to maps, forms and payments, as well as links to the most popular services. Also, if you scroll down, you can still see more traditional things like council news and events (as well as the lovely Google map, which utilises the premier Google Maps API, to get around the Ordnance Survey licensing restrictions). It&#x2019;s also very Google like, without ripping them off completely, which makes users (experienced and non-experienced) feel at home.</p>

<p>It&#x2019;s great that trailblazing councils are doing this work though. Hopefully now we&#x2019;ll see more and more councils following this line, so when we get to our next redesign, the powers that be will be much more comfortable with a simple homepage design.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<p>Some of you may have seen my <a href="http://www.pezholio.co.uk/2009/07/the-postcode-freed-well-sort-of/">blog post about the Ernest Marples API</a> a few weeks ago, and since then there&#x2019;s been no slapped wrists from the Post Office and a lot of people voicing their support</p>

<p>There&#x2019;s also been a <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/WWW-ErnestMarples/">Perl helper library</a> courtesy of <a href="http://hexten.net/">Andy Armstrong</a> and, as Perl looks a little bit like French to me, I thought I&#x2019;d get my hands dirty and build a little PHP function to add to the mix.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pezholio.co.uk/ernest_test.php">You can check it out and give it a test here</a> - basically all it does is accept a postcode and then returns an array with the original postcode, together with the latitude and longitude. It&#x2019;s pretty simple, but then again, the API is too, so there&#x2019;s no real point adding to it.</p>

<p>Feel free to nick the code, and use it as you see fit. If you are using it in a live project, it&#x2019;s probably a good idea to let the Ernest Marples guys know, so they can keep you up to date with the latest developments - enjoy!</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> The wonderful <a href="http://www.noginn.com/">Tom Graham</a> has made a few changes to this script to utilise the cURL library, which is handy if your server doesn&#x2019;t allow fopen to access external URLs. Check it out on <a href="http://gist.github.com/170266">Github</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<p>I&#x2019;ve been thinking recently about trending topics on Twitter and how it would be brilliant if there could be some kind of local trending system that picked up trends in a local area. Twitter already has location based searching, so it should be pretty trivial for a developer (albeit one with more skill than me)</p>

<p>Step forward <a href="http://www.happn.in">happn.in</a>, which allows you to see trending topics based on a pre-defined list of cities. Birmingham (the UK one) <a href="http://happn.in/birm">has an entry</a>, so, after finding out the system had an <a href="http://api.happn.in">api</a>. I got cracking on playing with it.</p>

<p>The result is <a href="http://www.pezholio.co.uk/brumtrends.php">Brumtrends</a> (updated broken link, thanks to @prettysimple for pointing this out!) and it displays trending topics as a tag cloud with a lovely photo of Brum&#x2019;s skyline. I knocked it up in about half an hour, so be kind!</p>

<p>I would like to expand on this, with maybe a widget for blogs, but, for now I&#x2019;m taking a &#x2018;wait and see&#x2019; approach. At the moment it seems to only take a few tweets for something to trend, and trends don&#x2019;t seem to change too often. Hopefully this will get better though, and this will grow into a really interesting insight into what&#x2019;s going on in the Birmingham digital community.</p>

<p><img src="http://ernestmarples.com/images/go.jpg" alt="">Pity the poor postcode, for years, he&#x2019;s been locked up in a basement at the Royal Mail offices, and only let out if someone pays a humungous fee to let him out.</p>

<p>Well, thanks to the mysterious <a href="http://ernestmarples.com">Ernest Marples</a>, the postcode has been let out of his cell and is free to run about, jump and play and be used in all sorts of useful applications.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://ernestmarples.com">Ernest Marples API</a> allows you to enter a postcode and get a latitude and longitude, allowing web-based applications to get a user&#x2019;s location from their postcode.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://jobcentreproplus.com/">few</a> <a href="http://www.planningalerts.com/">apps</a> <a href="http://thestraightchoice.com/">are</a> <a href="http://voteuk.shkspr.mobi/">already</a> <a href="http://livebus.org/">using</a> this, and with the API finally out in the open, hopefully more apps will join the club!</p>

<p>But how are they going to get away with this? Well, my theory is (and I&#x2019;ve not spoken to anyone involved in the project to confirm this) that as long as it&#x2019;s only used by volunteer / non-profit projects, then the Royal Mail ain&#x2019;t gonna do diddly squat. They&#x2019;re not losing any revenue by sites of this nature doing this because the sites couldn&#x2019;t afford to pay for the postcode database anyway. Besides, although the Royal Mail is effectively a private enterprise, the major shareholder is still the government, and I can&#x2019;t see them risking the bad publicity that would be caused by being heavy-handed and taking the site down.</p>

<p>However, I do think there are risks in putting this data out there, although the Royal Mail might not be bothered by non-profit sites using this data, they might be bothered by corporates (who would otherwise be paying) using it. Therefore I think the best way forward would be to make the API private - get developers to sign up for an API key and let &#x2018;Ernest&#x2019; know how they&#x2019;re planning to use it. That way, for profit sites don&#x2019;t get a look in.</p>

<p>It&#x2019;s certainly exciting though, and my best wishes go out to &#x2018;Ernest&#x2019;. I shall watch the future with interest!</p>

<p><img src="http://pezholio.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/JohnSmithsExtraCold-150x150.jpg" alt="John Smith's - because it's got a widget (Not that I'd actually drink the stuff)"></p>

<p>With the recent publication of the <a href="http://digitalbritainforum.org.uk/report/">Digital Britain report</a> and Gordon Brown <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8096273.stm">calling on Tim Berners-Lee to help open up access to government data</a>, there&#x2019;s been a lot of talk about public organisations opening up data.</p>

<p>Most of this has focused around APIs and linked data (something I&#x2019;m very passionate about already), but there&#x2019;s much simpler ways to get data out there that might be useful to those people who might have a website, know their way a bit round HTML, but aren&#x2019;t willing to get their hands dirty with XML, JSON or RDF.</p>

<p>I&#x2019;m talking of course, about widgets, these are little bits of (often Javascript) code that people can copy and paste into their own websites. These can then be used by local blogs, newspapers or other websites to publish your content in a quick and easy way.</p>

<p>I&#x2019;ve had a go at doing a few widgets, publishing <a href="http://www.ratemyplace.org.uk/linktous.php">food safety inspections</a> and <a href="http://www.lichfielddc.gov.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=1178">planning applications</a> as widgets and I&#x2019;m looking to do more in the future. Fellow blogger and techy Philip John has even turned one of our widgets into a <a href="http://philipjohn.co.uk/ratemyplace-wordpress-widget">Wordpress-compatible widget</a>, which I&#x2019;m proudly sporting on the right here.</p>

<p>Essentially, what you&#x2019;re doing is pulling information from a database (using PHP or whatever server-side technology you fancy) and outputting it as javascript code, wrapping it all in a document.write function. You can also use inline styling to style your widget, making sure you override any potential styles that might be overridden by the user&#x2019;s stylesheet. A quick and dirty example is below:</p>

<p>`
?php</p>

<p>$query = &#x201C;SELECT * FROM database&#x201D;;</p>

<p>$result = mysql_query($query) or die(mysql_error());</p>

<p>echo &#x201C;document.write(&#x2018;&#x201D;;</p>

<p>echo &#x201D;<h2></h2>&#34;font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;&#34;&gt;Planning Applications for Foo on Bar Council</p>&#x201D;;</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<p>Just a quick brain dump here, arising from a discussion that I had at the &#x2018;unpanel&#x2019; at Localgovcamp.</p>

<p>The online community in our council area is getting larger and more vocal, with blogs, pressure groups and other communities cropping up. Often, there are things said that attack the council. In the &#x2018;olden days&#x2019; (when attacks of this kind would only appear in the press) we&#x2019;d draft a response, it would go through an approvals process (Leader, Chief Exec, Portfolio holder etc etc) and it would be sent out to a newspaper.</p>

<p>Now, in the &#x2018;always on&#x2019; world of the internet, attacks and questions pop up at a moment&#x2019;s notice and this long process isn&#x2019;t always practical - it shows us up to be lumbering, slow and unresponsive. Campaigns can often gain momentum in the time we&#x2019;re spending getting approval and before we can add our voices to the conversation we find ourselves with a lot more firefighting to do.</p>

<p>If we could get responses out quicker with a lean, quick approvals process (or even (shock, horror) no approvals process at all!), we could get responses out quickly and give our side of the story before things go pear-shaped.</p>

<p>I&#x2019;m not a press officer, but I do work in a communications environment, and engaging with the online community is something I feel very passionate about. I feel we need to give online methods of communication the same importance we give the &#x2018;dead tree&#x2019; press, but make sure we tailor our approach, otherwise we risk being left in the dark ages.</p>

<p>Is anyone else modifying their approvals processes to reflect the web 2.0 world?</p>
